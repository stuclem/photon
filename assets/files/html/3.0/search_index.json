The guide also includes a section to get you started using Photon OS quickly and easily. \nPhoton OS is a Linux container host optimized for vSphere and cloud-computing platforms such as Amazon Elastic Compute and Google Compute Engine. As a lightweight and extensible operating system, Photon OS works with the most common container formats, including Docker, Rocket, and Garden. Photon OS includes a yum-compatible, package-based lifecycle management system called tdnf.\nWhen used with development tools and environments such as VMware Fusion, VMware Workstation, HashiCorp (Vagrant and Atlas), and production runtime environments (vSphere, vCloud Air), Photon OS lets you seamlessly migrate container-based applications from development to production. With a small footprint and fast boot and run times, Photon OS is optimized for cloud computing and cloud  applications.  \nThere are two versions of Photon OS: a minimal version and a full version. \nThe minimal version of Photon OS is lightweight container host runtime environment best suited to managing and hosting containers. The minimal version contains just enough packaging and functionality to manage and modify containers while remaining a fast runtime environment. The minimal version is ready to work with appliances. \nThe full version of Photon OS includes additional packages to help you customize the system and create containerized applications. For  running containers, the full version is excessive. The full version is targeted at helping you create, develop, test, and package an application that runs a container. \nTwo characteristics of Photon OS stand out: It manages services with systemd and it manages packages with an open source, yum-compatible package manager called tdnf, for Tiny DNF. \nBy using systemd, Photon OS adopts a contemporary Linux standard to manage system services. Photon OS bootstraps the user space and concurrently starts services with systemd. The systemctl utility controls services on Photon OS. For example, instead of running the /etc/init.d/ssh script to stop and start the OpenSSH server on a init.d-based Linux system, you run the following systemctl commands on Photon OS: \nsystemctl stop sshd\nsystemctl start sshd\nTdnf keeps the operating system as small as possible while preserving yum's robust package-management capabilities. On Photon OS, tdnf is the default package manager for installing new packages. It is a C implementation of DNF package manager. \nExamining the Packages in the SPECS Directory on Github\nThe SPECS directory of the GitHub website for Photon OS contains all the packages that can appear in Photon OS repositories:  \nhttps://github.com/vmware/photon/tree/master/SPECS\nTo see the version of a package, in the SPECS directory, click the name of the subdirectory of the package that you want to examine, and then click the .spec filename in the subdirectory. For example, the version of OpenJDK, which contains the openjre package that installs the Java class library and the javac Java compiler, looks like this: \n\n%define _use_internal_dependency_generator 0\nSummary:    OpenJDK \nName:        openjdk\nVersion:    1.8.0.72\nRelease:    1%{?dist}\nLicense:    GNU GPL\nURL:        https://openjdk.java.net\nGroup:        Development/Tools\nVendor:        VMware, Inc.\nDistribution:   Photon\nAutoReqProv:     no\nSource0:    http://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/files/BLFS/OpenJDK-%{version}/OpenJDK-%{version}-x86_64-bin.tar.xz\n%define sha1 OpenJDK=0c705d7b13f4e22611d2da654209f469a6297f26\n%description\nThe OpenJDK package installs java class library and javac java compiler. \n\n%package    -n openjre\nSummary:    Jave runtime environment\nAutoReqProv:     no\n%description    -n openjre\nIt contains the libraries files for Java runtime environment\n#%global __requires_exclude ^libgif.*$\n#%filter_from_requires ^libgif.*$...\n...\n\n\nLooking at the Differences Between the Minimal and the Full Version\nThe minimal version of Photon OS contains about 50 packages. As it is installed, the number of packages increases to nearly 100 to fulfill dependencies. The full version of Photon OS adds several hundred packages to those in the minimal version to deliver a more fully featured operating system. \nYou can view a list of the packages that appear in the minimal version by examining the following file: \nhttps://github.com/vmware/photon/blob/master/common/data/packages_minimal.json\nYou can view a list of the packages that appear in the full version by examining the following file: \nhttps://github.com/vmware/photon/blob/master/common/data/packages_full.json\nIf the minimal or the full version of Photon OS does not contain a package that you want, you can of course install it with tdnf, which appears in both the minimal and full versions of Photon OS by default. In the full version of Photon OS, you can also install packages by using yum. \nOne notable difference between the two versions of Photon OS pertains to OpenJDK, the package that contains not only the Java runtime environment (openjre) but also the Java compiler (javac). The OpenJDK package appears in the full but not the minimal version of Photon OS. To add support for Java programs to the minimal version of Photon OS, install the Java packages and their dependencies: \ntdnf install openjdk\nInstalling:\nopenjre     x86_64    1.8.0.92-1.ph1    95.09 M\nopenjdk     x86_64    1.8.0.92-1.ph1    37.63 M\nNOTE: openjdk and openjre are available as openjdk8 and openjre8 in Photon OS 2.0\nA later section covers tdnf. \nThe Root Account and the sudo and su Commands\nThis guide assumes that you are logged in to Photon OS with the root account and running commands as root. The sudo program comes with the full version of Photon OS. On the minimal version, you must install sudo with tdnf if you want to use it. As an alternative to installing sudo on the minimal version, you can switch users as needed with the su command to run commands that require root privileges. \nGetting Started with Photon OS 2.0\nNOTE: This section applies to Photon OS w.0 only.\nTo get started with Photon OS 2.0, refer to the installation instructions for your target environment:\n\nRunning Photon OS on VMware vSphere\nRunning Photon OS on VMware Fusion\nRunning Photon OS on VMware Workstation\nRunning Photon OS on Amazon EC2\nRunning Photon OS on Google Compute Engine\nRunning Photon OS on Microsoft Azure\n\nNote: If you want to upgrade an existing Photon 1.0 VM, refer to the instructions in Upgrading to Photon OS 2.0. \nQuick Start for Photon OS 1.0\nNOTE: This section applies to Photon OS 1.0 only.\nThis section helps you get Photon OS up and running quickly and easily. There are several ways to deploy Photon OS for free within a matter of minutes:\n\nObtain the ISO from Bintray and use it to create a virtual machine running Photon OS.\nInstall the OVA for the minimal version of Photon OS in VMware vSphere.\nRapidly deploy the OVA for the minimal version of Photon OS in VMware Workstation 12 Pro. \n\nObtaining the ISO from Bintray and Creating a Photon OS VM in VMware Workstation\nThe full version of Photon OS installs from an ISO in VMware Workstation and other hypervisors in a matter of minutes. Photon OS is a free download from the Bintray web site.\nThis section demonstrates how to create a virtual machine running Photon OS in VMware Workstation 12 Pro. If you are using a different hypervisor, the example set by this section should help you install it in your system. For instructions on how to install Photon OS from an ISO in VMware vSphere, see Installing Photon OS on VMware vSphere from an ISO Image.\n\nGo to the following Bintray URL and download the ISO for the general availability release of Photon OS:\n https://bintray.com/vmware/photon/iso/view\n\nIn VMware Workstation, type Ctrl+N to create a new virtual machine. \n\nIn the New Virtual Machine Wizard, select Typical, and then click Next.\n\nSelect Installer disk image file (iso), click Browse to locate the Photon OS ISO that you downloaded from Bintray, and then click Next.\n\nFor the guest operating system, select Linux. From the Version drop-down menu, select VMware Photon 64-bit. If you have an older version of VMware Workstation and Photon does not appear in the list, select Other Linux 3.x kernel 64-bit.\n\n\nClick Next through the remaining dialog boxes of the wizard,  either accepting the default settings, which is recommended, or making the changes that you want, and then click Finish.\n\nPower on the virtual machine and, in the Workstation window containing Photon, press Enter to start the installation.\n\n\nDuring disk setup, the installer might ask you to confirm that this will erase the disk. If so, accept the default value of yes by hitting your Enter key.\n\nSelect the installation that you want. For this example, choose Photon Full by using the tab key to move to Photon Full and then hitting the space bar to select it. Press Enter to install it. \n\nEither accept the default hostname that Photon provides or type the name that you want. Press Enter to continue. \n\nType the root password. Photon OS requires the root password to be a complex string containing no common words or names.\n\n\nThe installation typically completes in about 150 seconds for the full version and in less than 30 seconds for the minimal version. After the installation finishes, boot the system and log in as root with your root password. \nTo connect to Photon OS by SSH, see the section on permitting root login with SSH below.  \nYou can also build an ISO containing Photon OS from its source code on GitHub by following the instructions in the document on building Photon OS. \nInstalling the OVA for the Minimal Version in vSphere\nYou can download the OVA for the minimal version of Photon OS from Bintray and deploy it in vSphere in a matter of seconds. Here's how: \nDownload the OVA for the minimal version of Photon OS from the following URL: \nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon/ova\nTo install the OVA in vSphere, on the File menu, click Deploy OVF Template, and then click Browse to locate the image that you downloaded. Move through the Deploy OVF Template dialog boxes by clicking Next to accept the default settings, and then click Finish. \nIn vSphere Client, turn on the power of the Photon OS virtual machine and open a console to it.\nThe default password for the root account is changeme, and you must change it when you first login. For security, Photon OS forbids common dictionary words for the root password. \nThere are other options for installing Photon OS in vSphere, such as building an ISO from the source code. For more information about the versions of Photon and their installation options, see Running Photon OS on vSphere.\nRapidly Deploying the Photon OS OVA in VMware Workstation 12 Pro\nHere's how to rapidly deploy the OVA for Photon in VMware Workstation 12 Pro by using an up-to-date version of Firefox. The procedure in other browsers or another version of Workstation might be different. \nIn Firefox, download the OVA for the minimal version of Photon OS from this URL: \nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon/ova\nIn the download dialog box, select Open with VMware Workstation (default), like this:\n\nIn the Workstation Import dialog box, click Import.\n\nWorkstation creates a virtual machine from the Photon OS OVA template in a few seconds. In Workstation, power on the virtual machine and log in as root with the initial password of changeme.\nPhoton OS then prompts you to change the root password.  \nRoot Password Rules\nWhen you first log on a new Photon OS machine, you must set the root password to a complex string containing no common words or names. Photon OS rejects a root password that contains simplistic patterns, common words, or words derived from the name of your account. The rules apply only to the root password, not other user and group accounts. \nPermitting Root Login with SSH\nThe full version of Photon OS prevents root login with SSH by default. To permit root login over SSH, open /etc/ssh/sshd_config with the vim text editor and set PermitRootLogin to yes. \nVim is the default text editor available in both the full and minimal versions of Photon OS. (Nano is also in the full version.) After you modify the SSH daemon's configuration file, you must restart the sshd daemon for the changes to take effect. Example: \nvim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n# override default of no subsystems\nSubsystem       sftp    /usr/libexec/sftp-server\n\n# Example of overriding settings on a per-user basis\n#Match User anoncvs\n#       X11Forwarding no\n#       AllowTcpForwarding no\n#       PermitTTY no\n#       ForceCommand cvs server\nPermitRootLogin yes\nUsePAM yes\nSave your changes in vim and then restart the sshd daemon: \nsystemctl restart sshd\nYou can then connect to the Photon OS machine with the root account over SSH:\nsteve@ubuntu:~$ ssh root@198.51.100.131\nPXE Boot\nPhoton OS works with the Preboot Execution Environment, or PXE, to boot by retrieving software from a PXE server over a network connection. For instructions on how to set Photon OS to boot from a PXE server, see Network PXE Boot.\nKickstart\nPhoton OS supports kickstart for unattended installations through a CD-ROM or an HTTP server. On Photon OS, kickstart can set the hostname, password, run post-installation scripts, and add public keys for SSH. See Kickstart Support.\nChecking the Version and Build Number\nTo check the version and build number of Photon OS, concatenate /etc/photon-release. Example: \ncat /etc/photon-release\nVMware Photon Linux 1.0\nPHOTON_BUILD_NUMBER=a6f0f63\nThe build number in the results maps to the commit number on the VMware Photon OS GitHub commits page.\nTiny DNF for Package Management\nOn Photon OS, Tiny DNF, for Tiny Dandified Yum, is the default package manager for installing new packages. It is a C implementation of DNF package manager. The standard syntax for tdnf commands is the same as that for DNF: \ntdnf [options]  [...]\nYou can view its help information like this: \ntdnf --help\ntdnf -h\nPhoton OS 1.0 only: In the minimal version of Photon OS, tdnf serves as the sole package manager to streamline the operating system. The full version of Photon OS includes yum, a common utility that checks for, downloads, and automatically installs RPM packages. On the minimal version of Photon OS, you can install yum by using tdnf if you are unconcerned with the size of the operating system: tdnf install yum\nConfiguration Files and Repositories\nThe main configuration files reside in /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf. The configuration file looks like this: \ncat /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf\n[main]\ngpgcheck=1\ninstallonly_limit=3\nclean_requirements_on_remove=true\nrepodir=/etc/yum.repos.d\ncachedir=/var/cache/tdnf\nThe cache files for data and metadata reside in /var/cache/tdnf. \nThe repositories appear in /etc/yum.repos.d/ with .repo file extensions:\nls /etc/yum.repos.d/\nlightwave.repo\nphoton-extras.repo\nphoton-iso.repo\nphoton-updates.repo\nphoton.repo \nNote: Photon OS 1.0 (only) also includes the lightwave.repo.\nYou can list the the repositories by using the tdnf repolist command. Tdnf filters the results with enabled, disabled, and all. Running the command without specifying an argument returns the enabled repositories:  \ntdnf repolist\nrepo id             repo name                               status\nphoton-updates      VMware Photon Linux 2.0(x86_64)Updates  enabled\nphoton-extras       VMware Photon Extras 2.0(x86_64)        enabled\nphoton              VMware Photon Linux 2.0(x86_64)         enabled\nNote: Photon OS 1.0 (only) also includes the lightwave repository.\nThe photon-iso.repo, however, does not appear in the list of repositories because it is unavailable on the virtual machine from which these examples are taken. Photon-iso.repo is the default repository; it points to /media/cdrom. The contents of photon-iso.repo look like this: \ncat /etc/yum.repos.d/photon-iso.repo\n[photon-iso]\nname=VMWare Photon Linux 2.0(x86_64)\nbaseurl=file:///mnt/cdrom/RPMS\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/VMWARE-RPM-GPG-KEY\ngpgcheck=1\nenabled=0\nskip_if_unavailable=True\nThe local cache is populated with data from the repository: \nls -l /var/cache/tdnf/photon\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 May 18 22:52 repodata\nd-wxr----t 3 root root 4096 May  3 22:51 rpms\nYou can clear the cache to help troubleshoot a problem, but keep in mind that doing so might slow the performance of tdnf until the cache becomes repopulated with data. Here is how to clear the cache: \ntdnf clean all\nCleaning repos: photon photon-extras photon-updates lightwave\nCleaning up everything\nThe command purges the repository data from the cache: \nls -l /var/cache/tdnf/photon\ntotal 4\nd-wxr----t 3 root root 4096 May  3 22:51 rpms\nOptions for Commands\nYou can add the following options to tdnf commands. If the option to override a configuration is unavailable in a command, consider adding it to the configuration file, /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf.\nOPTION                     DESCRIPTION\n--allowerasing             Allow erasing of installed packages to resolve dependencies\n--assumeno                 Answer no for all questions\n--best                     Try the best available package versions in transactions\n--debugsolver              Dump data aiding in dependency solver debugging info.\n--disablerepo=     Disable specific repositories by an id or a glob.\n--enablerepo=      Enable specific repositories\n-h, --help                 Display help\n--refresh                  Set metadata as expired before running command\n--nogpgcheck               Skip gpg check on packages\n--rpmverbosity=\n                           Debug level for rpm\n--version                  Print version and exit\n-y, --assumeyes            Answer yes to all questions\n-q, --quiet                Quiet operation\nHere is an example that adds the short form of the assumeyes option to the install command:\ntdnf -y install gcc\nUpgrading:\ngcc     x86_64    5.3.0-1.ph1     91.35 M\nCommands\ncheck: Checks for problems in installed and available packages for all enabled repositories. Command has no arguments. You can use --enablerepo and --disablerepo to control the repos used. Supported in Photon OS 2.0 (only).\ncheck-local: This command resolves dependencies by using the local RPMs to help check RPMs for quality assurance before publishing them. To check RPMs with this command, you must create a local directory and place your RPMs in it. The command, which includes no options, takes the path to the local directory containing the RPMs as its argument. The command does not, however, recursively parse directories; it checks the RPMs only in the directory that you specify. For example, after creating a directory named /tmp/myrpms and placing your RPMs in it, you can run the following command to check them:  \ntdnf check-local /tmp/myrpms\nChecking all packages from: /tmp/myrpms\nFound 10 packages\nCheck completed without issues\ncheck-update: This command checks for updates to packages. It takes no arguments. The tdnf list updates command performs the same function. Here is an example of the check update command: \ntdnf check-update\nrpm-devel.x86_64     4.11.2-8.ph1     photon\nyum.noarch          3.4.3-3.ph1     photon\nclean: This command cleans up temporary files, data, and metadata. It takes the argument all. Example: \ntdnf clean all\nCleaning repos: photon photon-extras photon-updates lightwave\nCleaning up everything\ndistro-sync: This command synchronizes the machine's RPMs with the latest version of all the packages in the repository. Abridged example:\ntdnf distro-sync\n\nUpgrading:\nzookeeper                             x86_64        3.4.8-2.ph1               3.38 M\nyum                                   noarch        3.4.3-3.ph1               4.18 M\n\nTotal installed size: 113.01 M\n\nReinstalling:\nzlib-devel                            x86_64        1.2.8-2.ph1             244.25 k\nzlib                                  x86_64        1.2.8-2.ph1             103.93 k\nyum-metadata-parser                   x86_64        1.1.4-1.ph1              57.10 k\n\nTotal installed size: 1.75 G\n\nObsoleting:\ntftp                                  x86_64        5.2-3.ph1                32.99 k\n\nTotal installed size: 32.99 k\nIs this ok [y/N]:\ndowngrade: This command downgrades the package that you specify as an argument to the next lower package version. Example: \ntdnf downgrade boost\nDowngrading:\nboost                                 x86_64        1.56.0-2.ph1              8.20 M\nTotal installed size: 8.20 M\nIs this ok [y/N]:y\nDownloading:\nboost                                  2591470    100%\nTesting transaction\nRunning transaction\nComplete!\nTo downgrade to a version lower than the next one, you must specify it by name, epoch, version, and release, all properly hyphenated. Example: \ntdnf downgrade boost-1.56.0-2.ph1 \nerase: This command removes the package that you specify as an argument. Example: \ntdnf erase vim\nRemoving:\nvim                                   x86_64        7.4-4.ph1                 1.94 M\nTotal installed size: 1.94 M\nIs this ok [y/N]:\nYou can also erase multiple packages: \ntdnf erase docker cloud-init\ninfo: This command displays information about packages. It can take the name of a package. Or it can take one of the following arguments: all, available, installed, extras, obsoletes, recent, upgrades. Examples: \ntdnf info ruby\ntdnf info obsoletes\ntdnf info upgrades\ninstall: This command takes the name of a package as its argument. It then installs the package and its dependencies. Examples: \ntdnf install kubernetes\nYou can also install multiple packages: \ntdnf install python-curses lsof audit gettext chkconfig ntsysv bindutils \n     wget gawk irqbalance lvm2 cifs-utils c-ares distrib-compat\nlist: This command lists the packages of the package that you specify as the argument. The command can take one of the following arguments: all, available, installed, extras, obsoletes, recent, upgrades. \ntdnf list updates\nThe list of packages might be long. To more easily view it, you can concatenate it into a text file, and then open the text file in a text editor: \ntdnf list all > pkgs.txt\nvi pkgs.txt\nmakecache: This command updates the cached binary metadata for all known repositories. Example:\ntdnf makecache\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)Updates'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Extras 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)'\nMetadata cache created.\nprovides: This command finds the packages that provide the package that you supply as an argument. Examples: \ntdnf provides docker\ndocker-1.11.0-1.ph1.x86_64 : Docker\nRepo     : photon\ndocker-1.11.0-1.ph1.x86_64 : Docker\nRepo     : @System\nreinstall: This command reinstalls the packages that you specify. If some packages are unavailable or not installed, the command fails. Example: \ntdnf reinstall docker kubernetes\n\nReinstalling:\nkubernetes                            x86_64        1.1.8-1.ph1             152.95 M\ndocker                                x86_64        1.11.0-1.ph1             57.20 M\n\nTotal installed size: 210.15 M\nremove: This command removes a package. When removing a package, tdnf by default also removes dependencies that are no longer used if they were was installed by tdnf as a dependency without being explicitly requested by a user. You can modify the dependency removal by changing the clean_requirements_on_remove option in /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf to false. \ntdnf remove packagename\nsearch: This command searches for the attributes of packages. The argument can be the names of packages, as this example testifies: \ntdnf search docker kubernetes\ndocker : Docker\ndocker : Docker\ndocker-debuginfo : Debug information for package docker\ndocker : Docker\nkubernetes : Kubernetes cluster management\nkubernetes : Kubernetes cluster management\nkubernetes-debuginfo : Debug information for package kubernetes\nkubernetes : Kubernetes cluster management\nThe argument of the search command can also be a keyword or a combination of keywords and packages: \ntdnf search terminal bash\nrubygem-terminal-table : Simple, feature rich ascii table generation library\nncurses : Libraries for terminal handling of character screens\nmingetty : A minimal getty program for virtual terminals\nncurses : Libraries for terminal handling of character screens\nncurses : Libraries for terminal handling of character screens\nbash : Bourne-Again SHell\nbash-lang : Additional language files for bash\nbash-lang : Additional language files for bash\nbash : Bourne-Again SHell\nbash-debuginfo : Debug information for package bash\nbash : Bourne-Again SHell\nbash-lang : Additional language files for bash\nupgrade: This command upgrades the package or packages that you specify to an available higher version that tdnf can resolve. If the package is already the latest version, the command returns Nothing to do. Example: \ntdnf upgrade boost\n\nUpgrading:\nboost                                 x86_64        1.60.0-1.ph1              8.11 M\n\nTotal installed size: 8.11 M\nIs this ok [y/N]:y\n\nDownloading:\nboost                                  2785950    100%\nTesting transaction\nRunning transaction\n\nComplete!\nYou can also run the upgrade command with the refresh option to update the cached metadata with the latest information from the repositories. The following example refreshes the metadata and then checks for a new version of tdnf but does not find one, so tdnf takes no action: \ntdnf upgrade tdnf --refresh\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)Updates'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Extras 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)'\nNothing to do.\nupgrade-to: This command upgrades to the version of the package that you specify. Example:\ntdnf upgrade-to ruby2.3\nThe commands and options of tdnf are, at present, a subset of those of dnf. For more help with tdnf commands, see the DNF documentation.\nAdding a New Repository\nWith Photon OS, you can add a new repository from which tdnf installs packages. To do so, you create a repository configuration file with a .repo extension and place it in /etc/yum.repos.d. The repository can be on either the Internet or a local server containing your in-house applications. \nBe careful if you add a repository that's on the Internet: Installing packages from untrusted or unverified sources might put the security, stability, or compatibility of your system at risk. It might also make your system harder to maintain.  \nOn Photon OS, the existing repositories appear in /etc/yum.repos.d:\nls /etc/yum.repos.d/\nlightwave.repo\nphoton-extras.repo\nphoton-iso.repo\nphoton-updates.repo\nphoton.repo \nLooking at one of the .repo files reveals the format and information that a new repository configuration file should contain:\ncat /etc/yum.repos.d/lightwave.repo\n[lightwave]\nname=VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)\nbaseurl=https://dl.bintray.com/vmware/lightwave\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/VMWARE-RPM-GPG-KEY\ngpgcheck=1\nenabled=1\nskip_if_unavailable=True\nThe minimal information needed to establish a repository is an ID and human-readable name of the repository and its base URL. The ID, which appears in square brackets, must be one word that is unique amoung the system's repositories; in the example above, it is [lightwave].\nThe baseurl is a URL for the repository's repodata directory. For a repository on a local server that can be accessed directly or mounted as a file system, the base URL can be a file referenced by file://. Example:  \nbaseurl=file:///server/repo/\nThe gpgcheck setting specifies whether to check the GPG signature. The gpgkey setting furnishes the URL for the repository's ASCII-armored GPG key file. Tdnf uses the GPG key to verify a package if its key has not been imported into the RPM database.\nThe enabled setting tells tdnf whether to poll the repository. If enabled is set to 1, tdnf polls it; if it is set to 0, tdnf ignores it. \nThe skip_if_unavailable setting instructs tdnf to continue running if the repository goes offline.\nOther options and variables can appear in the repository file. The variables that go with some of the options can reduce future changes to the repository configuration files. There are variables to replace the value of the version of the package and to replace the base architecture. For more information, see the man page for yum.conf on the full version of Photon OS: man yum.conf\nHere is an example of how to add a new repository for a local server that tdnf polls for packages:\ncat > /etc/yum.repos.d/apps.repo Because this new repository resides on a local server, make sure the Photon OS machine can connect to it by, for instance, mounting it. \nAfter establishing a new repository, you must run the following command to update the cached binary metadata for the repositories that tdnf polls. Example:\ntdnf makecache\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)Updates'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Extras 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'Local In-House Applications(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)'\nMetadata cache created.\nAdding the Dev Repository to Get New Packages from the GitHub Dev Branch\nIf you want to try out new packages or the latest versions of existing packages as they are merged into the dev branch of the Photon OS GitHub site, you can add the dev repository to your repository list. Here's how: \nOn your Photon OS machine, run the following command as root to create a repository configuration file named photon-dev.repo, place it in /etc/yum.repos.d, and concatenate the repository's information into the file: \ncat > /etc/yum.repos.d/photon-dev.repo After establishing a new repository, you must run the following command to update the cached binary metadata for the repositories that tdnf polls:\ntdnf makecache\nManaging Services with systemd\nPhoton OS manages services with systemd. By using systemd, Photon OS adopts a contemporary Linux standard to bootstrap the user space and concurrently start services--an architecture that differs from traditional Linux systems such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. \nA traditional Linux system contains an initialization system called SysVinit. With SLES 11, for instance, SysVinit-style init programs control how the system starts up and shuts down. Init implements system runlevels. A SysVinit runlevel defines a state in which a  process or service runs. \nIn contrast to a SysVinit system, systemd defines no such runlevels. Instead, systemd uses a dependency tree of targets to determine which services to start when. Combined with the declarative nature of systemd commands, systemd targets reduce the amount of code needed to run a command, leaving you with code that is easier to maintain and probably faster to execute. For an overview of systemd, see systemd System and Service Manager and the man page for systemd.\nOn Photon OS, you should manage services with systemd and its command-line utility for inspecting and controlling the system, systemctl, not the deprecated commands of init.d. \nThe following sections present a brief overview of useful systemctl commands and options for examining and managing the state of systemd services. For more information, see the index of all the systemd man pages, including systemctl, at the following URL: \nhttps://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/\nViewing Services\nTo view a description of all the active, loaded units, execute the systemctl command without any options or arguments: \nsystemctl\nTo see all the loaded, active, and inactive units and their description, run this command: \nsystemctl --all\nTo see all the unit files and their current status but no description, run this command: \nsystemctl list-unit-files\nThe grep command filters the services by a search term, a helpful tactic to recall the exact name of a unit file without looking through a long list of names. Example: \nsystemctl list-unit-files | grep network\norg.freedesktop.network1.busname           static\ndbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service      enabled\nsystemd-networkd-wait-online.service       enabled\nsystemd-networkd.service                   enabled\nsystemd-networkd.socket                    enabled\nnetwork-online.target                      static\nnetwork-pre.target                         static\nnetwork.target                             static\nControlling Services\nTo control services on Photon OS, you use systemctl. For example, instead of running the /etc/init.d/ssh script to stop and start the OpenSSH server on a init.d-based Linux system, you run the following systemctl commands on Photon OS: \nsystemctl stop sshd\nsystemctl start sshd\nThe systemctl tool includes a range of commands and options for inspecting and controlling the state of systemd and the service manager; for more information, see the systemctl man page.\nCreating a Startup Service\nThis section shows you how to create a systemd startup service that changes the maximum transmission unit, or MTU, of the default Ethernet connection, eth0.\nFirst, concatenate the following block of code into a file: \ncat > /lib/systemd/system/eth0.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Network interface initialization\nAfter=local-fs.target network-online.target network.target\nWants=local-fs.target network-online.target network.target\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/bin/ifconfig eth0 mtu 1460 up\nType=oneshot\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nEOF\nSecond, set the service to auto-start when the system boots: \ncd /lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/\nln -s ../eth0.service eth0.service\nDisabling the Photon OS httpd.service\nIf your application or appliance includes its own HTTP server, you should turn off and disable the HTTP server that comes with Photon OS so that it does not conflict with your own HTTP server. \nTo stop it and disable it, run the following commands as root: \nsystemctl stop httpd.service\nsystemctl disable httpd.service\nAuditing System Events with auditd\nBecause Photon OS emphasizes security, the Linux auditing service, auditd, is enabled and active by default on the full version of Photon OS: \nsystemctl status auditd\n* auditd.service - Security Auditing Service\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/auditd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Fri 2016-04-29 15:08:50 UTC; 1 months 9 days ago\n Main PID: 250 (auditd)\n   CGroup: /system.slice/auditd.service\n           `-250 /sbin/auditd -n\nTo help improve security, the auditd service can monitor file changes, system calls, executed commands, authentication events, and network access. After you implement an audit rule to monitor an event, the aureport tool generates reports to display information about the events. \nYou can, for instance, use the auditctl utility to set a rule that monitors the sudoers file for changes:\nauditctl -w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k sudoers_changes\nThis rule specifies that the auditd service watch (-w) the /etc/sudoers file to log permissions changes (p) to the write access (w) or attributes (a) of the file and to identify them in logs as sudoers_changes. The auditing logs appear in /var/log/audit/audit.log. You can list the auditing rules like this: \nauditctl -l\n-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k sudoers_changes\nFor more information on the Linux Audit Daemon, see its man page on Photon OS: \nman auditd\nFor more information on setting auditing rules and options with auditctl, see its man page:\nman auditctl\nFor more information on viewing reports on audited events, see the aureport man page:\nman aureport\nAnalyzing systemd Logs with journalctl\nThe journalctl tool queries the contents of the systemd journal. For help troubleshooting systemd, two journalctl queries are particularly useful: showing the log entries for the last boot and showing the log entries for a systemd service unit. \nThis command displays the messages that systemd generated during the last time the machine started: \njournalctl -b\nThis command reveals the messages for only the systemd service unit specified by the -u option, which is auditd in the following example: \njournalctl -u auditd\nFor more information, see the journalctl man page by running this command on Photon OS: man journalctl\nMigrating Scripts to systemd\nAlthough systemd maintains compatibility with init.d scripts, you should, as a best practice, adapt the scripts that you want to run on Photon OS to systemd to avoid potential problems. Such a conversion standardizes the scripts, reduces the footprint of your code, makes the scripts easier to read and maintain, and improves their robustness on a systemd system.\nManaging the Network Configuration\nThe network service, which is enabled by default, starts when the system boots. You manage the network service by using systemd commands, such as systemd-networkd, systemd-resolvd, and networkctl. You can check its status of the network service by running the following command: \nsystemctl status systemd-networkd\nHere is a healthy result of the command: \n* systemd-networkd.service - Network Service\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Fri 2016-04-29 15:08:51 UTC; 6 days ago\n     Docs: man:systemd-networkd.service(8)\n Main PID: 291 (systemd-network)\n   Status: \"Processing requests...\"\n   CGroup: /system.slice/systemd-networkd.service\n           `-291 /lib/systemd/systemd-networkd\nBecause Photon OS relies on systemd to manage services, you should employ the systemd suite of commands, not deprecated init.d commands or other deprecated commands, to manage networking. \nUsing the Photon Management Daemon\nThe Photon Management Daemon (PMD) that ships with Photon OS 2.0 provides the remote management of a Photon instance via several APIs: a command line client (pmd-cli), a REST API, and a Python API. The PMD provides the ability to manage network interfaces, packages, firewalls, users, and user groups.\nInstalling the pmd Package\nThe pmd package is included with your Photon OS 2.0 distribution. To make sure that you have the latest version, you can run:\n# tdnf install pmd\n# systemctl start pmd\nAvailable APIs\npmd-cli\nThe pmd-cli utility enables Photon customers to invoke API requests securely on local and remote servers. For details, see Photon Management Daemon Command-line Interface (pmd-cli).\nPMD REST API\nThe PMD REST API is an openapi 2.0 specification. Once the pmd package is installed, you can use a Swagger UI tool to browse the REST API specifications (/etc/pmd/restapispec.json).\nYou can also browse it using the copenapi_cli tool that comes with the pmd package:\n# copenapi_cli --apispec /etc/pmd/restapispec.json\nFor more information about the copenapi_cli tool, refer to github.com/vmware/copenapi.\nPMD Python API\nPython3 is included with your Photon OS 2.0 distribution. PMD Python interfaces are available for python3 (pmd-python3) and python2 (pmd-python2). You can use tdnf to ensure that the latest version is installed:\n# tdnf install pmd-python3\n# systemctl start pmd\nTo navigate the help documentation for the pmd Python packages:\n# python3\n>>> import pmd\n>>> net = pmd.server().net\n>>> help(pmd)\nTo show help text for individual interfaces:\n>>> help(pmd.server().net)\n>>> help(pmd.server().pkg)\n>>> help(pmd.server().firewall)\n>>> help(pmd.server().user)\nFor details about the network commands, see also the Network Configuration Manager - Python API.\nPMD C Documentation\nPMD C APIs are defined in the header files (pmd_fwmgmt.h, pmd_netmgr.h, pmd_pkgmgmt.h, pmd_usermgmt.h) that are stored in the following location:  \n[https://github.com/vmware/pmd/tree/master/include](https://github.com/vmware/pmd/tree/master/include)\nFor details about the network commands, see also the Network Configuration Manager - C API.\nUsing the Network Configuration Manager\nThe Network Configuration Manager library that ships with Photon OS 2.0 provides a collection of C, Python, and CLI APIs that simplify common onfiguration tasks for:\n\ninterfaces\nIP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses)\nroutes\nDNS server and domain settings\nDHCP DUID and IAID settings\nNTP server settings\nservice management\nobject parameters (interfaces and files)\n\nFor additional details, see:\n\nCLI - see the -net commands in the Photon Management Daemon Command-line Interface (pmd-cli)\nC APIs - Network Configuration Manager - C API\nPython APIs - Network Configuration Manager - Python API\n\nUse ip and ss Commands Instead of ifconfig and netstat\nAlthough the ifconfig command and the netstat command work on Photon OS, VMware recommends that you use the ip or ss commands. The ipconfig and netstat commands are deprecated. \nFor example, instead of running netstat to display a list of network interfaces, run the ss command. Similarly, to display information for IP addresses, instead of running ifconfig -a, run the ip addr command. Examples:\nUSE THIS IPROUTE COMMAND     INSTEAD OF THIS NET-TOOL COMMAND\nip addr                     ifconfig -a\nss                             netstat\nip route                     route\nip maddr                     netstat -g\nip link set eth0 up         ifconfig eth0 up\nip -s neigh                    arp -v\nip link set eth0 mtu 9000    ifconfig eth0 mtu 9000\nUsing the ip route version of a command instead of the net-tools version often provides more complete, accurate information on Photon OS, as the following example demonstrates: \nip neigh\n198.51.100.2 dev eth0 lladdr 00:50:56:e2:02:0f STALE\n198.51.100.254 dev eth0 lladdr 00:50:56:e7:13:d9 STALE\n198.51.100.1 dev eth0 lladdr 00:50:56:c0:00:08 DELAY\n\narp -a\n? (198.51.100.2) at 00:50:56:e2:02:0f [ether] on eth0\n? (198.51.100.254) at 00:50:56:e7:13:d9 [ether] on eth0\n? (198.51.100.1) at 00:50:56:c0:00:08 [ether] on eth0\nConfiguring Network Interfaces\nNetwork configuration files for systemd-networkd reside in /etc/systemd/network and /usr/lib/systemd/network. Example:\nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# ls /etc/systemd/network/\n99-dhcp-en.network\nBy default, when Photon OS starts, it creates a DHCP network configuration file, or rule, which appears in /etc/systemd/network, the highest priority directory for network configuration files with the lowest priority filename:\ncat /etc/systemd/network/99-dhcp-en.network\n[Match]\nName=e*\n\n[Network]\nDHCP=yes\nNetwork configuration files can also appear in the system network directory, /usr/lib/systemd/network, as the results of the following search illustrate:\nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# updatedb\nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# locate systemd/network\n/etc/systemd/network\n/etc/systemd/network/99-dhcp-en.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-host0.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-ve.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]#\nAs you can see, the /usr/lib/systemd/network directory contains several network configuration files. Photon OS applies the configuration files in the lexicographical order specified by the file names without regard for the network configuration directory in which the file resides unless the file name is the same. Photon OS processes files with identical names by giving precedence to files in the /etc directory over the other directory. Thus, the settings in /etc/systemd/network override those in /usr/lib/systemd/network. Once Photon OS matches an interface in a file, Photon OS ignores the interface if it appears in files processed later in the lexicographical order. \nEach .network file contains a matching rule and a configuration that Photon OS applies when a device matches the rule. You set the matching rule and the configuration as sections containing vertical sets of key-value pairs according to the information at https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.network.html. \nTo configure Photon OS to handle a networking use case, such as setting a static IP address or adding a name server, you create a configuration file with a .network extension and place it in the /etc/systemd/network directory.\nAfter you create a network configuration file with a .network extension, you must run the chmod command to set the new file's mode bits to 644. Example: \nchmod 644 10-static-en.network\nFor Photon OS to apply the new configuration, you must restart the systemd-networkd service by running the following command: \nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nFor information about network configuration files, their processing order, and their matching rules, sections, and keys, see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.network.html.\nFor information about creating virtual network device files (.netdev), see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.netdev.html.\nSetting a Static IP Address\nBefore you set a static IP address, obtain the name of your Ethernet link by running the following command: \nnetworkctl\nIDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL SETUP\n  1 lo               loopback           carrier     unmanaged\n  2 eth0             ether              routable    configured\nIn the results of the command, you can see the name of an Ethernet link, eth0.\nTo create a network configuration file that systemd-networkd uses to establish a static IP address for the eth0 network interface, execute the following command as root: \ncat > /etc/systemd/network/10-static-en.network Change the new file's mode bits by running the chmod command:\nchmod 644 10-static-en.network\nApply the configuration by running the following command:\nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nFor more information, see the man page for systemd-networkd: man systemd.network\nTurning Off DHCP\nBy default, when Photon OS first starts, it creates a DHCP network configuration file, or rule, which appears in /etc/systemd/network, the highest priority directory for network configuration files with the lowest priority filename:\n    cat /etc/systemd/network/99-dhcp-en.network\n    [Match]\n    Name=e*\n[Network]\nDHCP=yes\nTo turn off DHCP for all Ethernet interfaces, change the value of DHCP from yes to no, save the changes, and then restart the systemd-networkd service: \nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nIf you create a configuration file with a higher priority filename (e.g. 10-static-en.network), it is not necessary but still recommended to turn off DHCP.\nAdding a DNS Server\nPhoton OS resolves domain names, IP addresses, and network names for local applications by using systemd-resolved. The systemd-resolved daemon automatically creates and maintains the /etc/resolv.conf file, into which systemd-resolved places the IP address of the DNS server. You should therefore never modify the /etc/resolv.conf file.\n(If you want to implement a local resolver like bind instead of systemd-resolved, stop the systemd-resolved service and disable it.)\nIf you open the default /etc/resolv.conf file after you deploy Photon OS, it looks like this: \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# cat /etc/resolv.conf\n# This file is managed by systemd-resolved(8). Do not edit.\n#\n# Third party programs must not access this file directly, but\n# only through the symlink at /etc/resolv.conf. To manage\n# resolv.conf(5) in a different way, replace the symlink by a\n# static file or a different symlink.\n\nnameserver 198.51.100.2\nTo add a DNS server to your static network configuration file, insert a DNS key into the Network section of, in this example, /etc/systemd/network/10-eth0-static.network and set it to the IP address of your DNS server: \n[Match]\nName=e*\n\n[Network]\nAddress=198.51.0.2/24\nGateway=198.51.0.1\nDNS=198.51.0.1\nAnother way of adding a DNS server is to modify /etc/systemd/resolved.conf--a method that can be particularly useful when your machine is working with DHCP. For more information, see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/resolved.conf.html.\nYou can optionally activate the local DNS stub resolver of systemd-resolved by adding dns and resolve to /etc/nsswitch.conf. To do so, make a backup copy of /etc/nsswitch.conf and then execute the following command as root:\nsed -i 's/^hosts.*$/hosts: files resolve dns/' /etc/nsswitch.conf\nFor more information on the systemd-resolved service, see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-resolved.service.html.\nSetting Up Networking for Multiple NICs\nIf your machine contains multiple NICs, you should, as a best practice, create a .network configuration file for each network interface. The following scenario demonstrates how to set one wired network interface to use a static IP address and another wired network interface to use a dynamic IP address obtained through DHCP. Keep in mind that the following configurations are examples: You must change the IP addresses and other information to match your network and requirements.  \nFirst, create the .network file for the static Ethernet connection in /etc/systemd/network. A best practice is to match the exact name of the network interface, which is in this example eth0. This example file also includes a DNS server for the static IP address. As a result, the configuration sets the UseDNS key to false in the DHCP column so that Photon OS ignores the DHCP server for DNS for this interface.  \ncat > /etc/systemd/network/10-eth0-static-en.network Second, create the .network file for the second network interface, which is named eth1 in this example. This configuration file sets the eth1 interface to an IP address from DHCP and sets DHCP as the source for DNS lookups. Setting the DHCP key to yes acquires an IP address for IPv4 and IPv6. To acquire an IP address for IPv4 only, set the DHCP key to ipv4.\ncat > /etc/systemd/network/50-eth1-dhcp-en.network Combining DHCP and Static IP Addresses with IPv4 and IPv6\nThis section presents examples that demonstrate how to combine DHCP and static IP addresses with both IPv4 and IPv6. \nHere's how to use DHCP to allocate both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:\n[Network]\nDHCP=yes\nHere's how to use DHCP to allocate only IPv4 addresses:\n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv4\nHere's how to use DHCP to allocate only IPv6 addresses:\n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv6\nHere's how to use DHCP for IPv4 addresses and static IP addresses for IPv6 addresses: \n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv4\nAddress=fd00::1/48\nGateway=fd00::252\nHere's how to use DHCP for IPv6 addresses and static IP addresses for IPv4: \n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv6\nAddress=10.10.10.1/24\nGateway=10.10.10.253\nHere's how to use static IP addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6: \n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv6\nAddress=10.10.10.1/24\nGateway=10.10.10.253\nAddress=fd00::1/48\nGateway=fd00::252\nClearing the Machine ID of a Cloned Instance for DHCP\nPhoton OS uses the contents of /etc/machine-id to determine the DHCP unique identifier (duid) that is used for DHCP requests. If you use a Photon OS instance as the base system for cloning to create additional Photon OS instances, you should clear the machine-id with this command: \necho -n > /etc/machine-id\nWith the value cleared, systemd regenerates the machine-id and, as a result, all DHCP requests will contain a unique duid. \nUsing Predictable Network Interface Names\nOn a virtual machine running Photon OS, just as on a bare-metal machine, the Ethernet network interface name might shift from one device to another if you add or removed a card and reboot the machine. A device named eth2, for example, might become eth1 after a NIC is removed and the machine is restarted.\nYou can prevent interface names from reordering by turning on predictable network interface names. The naming schemes that Photon OS uses can then assign fixed, predictable names to network interfaces even after cards or other firmware are added or removed and the system is restarted. With predictable network interface names enabled, you can select among several options to assign persistent names to network interfaces:\n\nApply the slot name policy to set the name of networking devices in the ens format with a statically assigned PCI slot number.\nApply the mac name policy to set the name of networking devices in the enx format a unique MAC address. \nApply the path name policy to set the name of networking devices in the enpXsY format derived from a device connector's physical location.\n\n(Although Photon OS also supports the onboard name policy to set in the eno format the name of networking devices from index numbers given by the firmware, the onboard policy might result in nonpersistent names.) \nThe option that you choose depends on your use case and your unique networking requirements. If, for instance, you clone clones virtual machines in a use case that requires the MAC addresses to be different from one another but the interface name to be the same, you should consider using ens to keep the slot the same after reboots. \nAlternatively, if the cloning function supports it and it works for your use case, you can use enx to set a MAC address, which also persists after reboots. \nHere's how to turn on predictable network interface names.\nFirst, make a backup copy of the following file in case you need to restore it later: \ncp /boot/grub/grub.cfg /boot/grub/grub.cfg.original\nSecond, to turn on predictable network interface names, edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg to remove the following string: \nnet.ifnames=0\nThe string appears near the bottom of the file in the menuentry section:\nmenuentry \"Photon\" {\n    linux \"/boot/\"$photon_linux root=$rootpartition net.ifnames=0 $photon_cmdline\n    if [ \"$photon_initrd\" ]; then\n        initrd \"/boot/\"$photon_initrd\n    fi\n}\n# End /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nEdit out net.ifnames=0, but make no other changes to the file, and then save it. \nThird, specify the types of policies that you want to use for predictable interface names by modifying the NamePolicy option in /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link. Here's what the file looks like: \ncat /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n[Link]\nNamePolicy=kernel database\nMACAddressPolicy=persistent\nTo use the ens or enx option, the slot policy or the mac policy can be added to the space-separated list of policies that follow the NamePolicy option in the default link file, /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link. The order of the policies matters: Photon OS applies the policy listed first before proceeding to the next policy if the first one fails. Example: \n/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n[Link]\nNamePolicy=slot mac kernel database\nMACAddressPolicy=persistent\nWith the name policy specified in the above example, it's possible that you could still end up with an Ethernet-style interface name if the two previous policies, slot and mac, fail. \nFor information on setting name policies, see systemd.link--network device configuration. \nInspecting the Status of Network Links with networkctl\nThe networkctl command shows information about network connections that helps you configure networking services and troubleshoot networking problems. You can, for example, progressively add options and arguments to the networkctl command to move from general information about network connections to specific information about a network connection. \nRunning networkctl without options defaults to the list command:  \nnetworkctl\nIDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL SETUP\n  1 lo               loopback           carrier     unmanaged\n  2 eth0             ether              routable    configured\n  3 docker0          ether              routable    unmanaged\n 11 vethb0aa7a6      ether              degraded    unmanaged\n 4 links listed.\nRunning networkctl with the status command displays information that looks like this; you can see that there are active network links with IP addresses for not only the Ethernet connection but also a Docker container. \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# networkctl status\n*      State: routable\n     Address: 198.51.100.131 on eth0\n              172.17.0.1 on docker0\n              fe80::20c:29ff:fe55:3ca6 on eth0\n              fe80::42:f0ff:fef7:bd81 on docker0\n              fe80::4c84:caff:fe76:a23f on vethb0aa7a6\n     Gateway: 198.51.100.2 on eth0\n         DNS: 198.51.100.2\nYou can then add a network link, such as the Ethernet connection, as the argument of the status command to show specific information about the link: \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# networkctl status eth0\n* 2: eth0\n       Link File: /usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n    Network File: /etc/systemd/network/99-dhcp-en.network\n            Type: ether\n           State: routable (configured)\n            Path: pci-0000:02:01.0\n          Driver: e1000\n      HW Address: 00:0c:29:55:3c:a6 (VMware, Inc.)\n             MTU: 1500\n         Address: 198.51.100.131\n                  fe80::20c:29ff:fe55:3ca6\n         Gateway: 198.51.100.2\n             DNS: 198.51.100.2\n        CLIENTID: ffb6220feb00020000ab116724f520a0a77337\nAnd you can do the same thing with the Docker container: \nnetworkctl status docker0\n* 3: docker0\n       Link File: /usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n    Network File: n/a\n            Type: ether\n           State: routable (unmanaged)\n          Driver: bridge\n      HW Address: 02:42:f0:f7:bd:81\n             MTU: 1500\n         Address: 172.17.0.1\n                  fe80::42:f0ff:fef7:bd81\nIn the example above, it is OK that the state of the Docker container is unmanaged; Docker handles managing the networking for the containers without using systemd-resolved or systemd-networkd. Instead, Docker manages the container's connection by using its bridge drive.\nFor more information about networkctl commands and options, see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/networkctl.html.\nTurning on Network Debugging\nYou can set systemd-networkd to work in debug mode so that you can analyze log files with debugging information to help troubleshoot networking problems. The following procedure turns on network debugging by adding a drop-in file in /etc/systemd to customize the default systemd configuration in /usr/lib/systemd. \nFirst, run the following command as root to create a directory with this exact name, including the .d extension:\nmkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/\nSecond, run the following command as root to establish a systemd drop-in unit with a debugging configuration for the network service:\ncat > /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/10-loglevel-debug.conf You must reload the systemctl daemon and restart the systemd-networkd service for the changes to take effect: \nsystemctl daemon-reload\nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nVerify that your changes took effect:\nsystemd-delta --type=extended\nView the log files by running this command: \njournalctl -u systemd-networkd\nWhen you are finished debugging the network connections, turn debugging off by deleting the drop-in file: \nrm /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/10-loglevel-debug.conf\nMounting a Network File System\nTo mount a network file system, Photon OS requires nfs-utils. The nfs-utils package contains the daemon, userspace server, and client tools for the kernel Network File System, or NFS. The tools include mount.nfs, umount.nfs, and showmount. \nThe nfs-utils package is installed by default in the full version of Photon OS but not in the minimal version. To install nfs-utils in the minimal version, run the following command as root: \ntdnf install nfs-utils\nFor instructions on how to use nfs-utils to share files over a network, see Photon OS nfs-utils.\nInstalling the Packages for tcpdump and netcat with tdnf\nThe minimal version of Photon OS leaves out several useful networking tools to keep the operating system lean. Tcpdump, for example, is absent in the minimal version but available in the repository. The minimal version does, however, include the iproute2 tools by default. \nTcpdump captures and analyzes packets on a network interface. On Photon OS, you install tcpdump and its accompanying package libpcap, a C/C++ library for capturing network traffic, by using tdnf, Photon's command-line package manager: \ntdnf install tcpdump\nNetcat, a tool for sending data over network connections with TCP or UDP, appears in neither the minimal nor the full version of Photon OS. But since netcat furnishes powerful options for analyzing, troubleshooting, and debugging network connections, you might want to install it. To do so, run the following command: \ntdnf install netcat\nCloud-Init on Photon OS\nThe minimal and full versions of Photon OS include the cloud-init service as a built-in component. Cloud-init is a set of Python scripts that initialize cloud instances of Linux machines. The cloud-init scripts configure SSH keys and run commands to customize the machine without user interaction. The commands can set the root password, create a hostname, configure networking, write files to disk, upgrade packages, run custom scripts, and restart the system. \nThere are several ways in which you can deploy Photon OS with cloud-init, including the following: \n\nAs a stand-alone Photon machine\nIn Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, called EC2\nIn the Google cloud through the Google Compute Engine, or GCE\nIn a VMware Vsphere private cloud \n\nWhen a cloud instance of Photon OS starts, cloud-init requires a data source. The data source can be an EC2 file for Amazon's cloud platform, a seed.iso for a stand-alone instance of Photon OS, or the internal capabilities of a system for managing virtual machines, such as VMware vSphere or vCenter. Cloud-init also includes data sources for OpenStack, Apache CloudStack, and OVF. The data source comprises two parts: \n\nMetadata\nUser data\n\nThe metadata gives the cloud service provider instructions on how to implement the Photon OS machine in the cloud infrastructure. Metadata typically includes the instance ID and the local host name. \nThe user data contains the commands and scripts that Photon OS executes when it starts in the cloud. The user data commonly takes the form of a shell script or a YAML file containing a cloud configuration. The cloud-init documentation contains information about the types of data sources and the formats for metadata and user data. \nOn Photon OS, cloud-init is enabled and running by default. You can check its status like this: \nsystemctl status cloud-init \nThe Photon OS directory that contains the local data and other resources for cloud-init is here: \n/var/lib/cloud\nPhoton OS stores the logs for cloud-init in the following file:\n/var/log/cloud-init.log\nThe following sections demonstrate how to use cloud-init to customize a stand-alone Photon OS machine, instantiate a Photon OS machine in the Amazon EC2 cloud, and deploy a virtual machine running Photon OS in vSphere. Each section uses a different combination of the available options for the metadata and the user data that make up the data source. Specifications, additional options, and examples appear in the cloud-init documentation. \nCreating a Stand-Alone Photon Machine with cloud-init\nCloud-init can customize a Photon OS virtual machine by using the nocloud data source. The nocloud data source bundles the cloud-init metadata and user data into a ISO that acts as a seed when you boot the machine. This seed.iso delivers the metadata and the user data without requiring a network connection. \nHere's how customize a Photon OS VM with a nocloud data source:\nFirst, create the metadata file with the following lines in the YAML format and name it meta-data:\ninstance-id: iid-local01\nlocal-hostname: cloudimg\nSecond, create the user data file with the following lines in YAML and name it user-data:\n#cloud-config\nhostname: testhost\npackages:\n - vim\nThird, generate the ISO that will serve as the seed; the ISO must have the volume ID set to cidata. In this example, the ISO is generated on an Ubuntu 14.04 computer containing the files named meta-data and user-data in the local directory: \ngenisoimage -output seed.iso -volid cidata -joliet -rock user-data meta-data\nThe ISO now appears in the current directory: \nsteve@ubuntu:~$ ls\nmeta-data seed.iso user-data\nOptionally, you can check the ISO that you generated on Ubuntu by transferring the ISO to the root directory of your Photon OS machine and then running the following command: \ncloud-init --file seed.iso --debug init\nAfter running the cloud-init command above, check the cloud-init log file: \nmore /var/log/cloud-init.log\nFinally, attach the ISO to the Photon OS virtual machine as a CD-ROM and reboot it so that the changes specified by seed.iso take effect. In this case, cloud-init sets the hostname and adds the vim package.\nCustomizing a Photon OS Machine on EC2\nThis section illustrates how to upload an ami image of Photon OS to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and customize the Photon OS machine by using cloud-init with an EC2 data source. The Amazon machine image version of Photon OS is available as a free download on Bintray:\nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon/\nThe cloud-init service is commonly used on EC2 to configure the cloud instance of a Linux image. On EC2, for example, cloud-init typically sets the .ssh/authorized_keys file to let you log in with a private key from another computer--that is, a computer besides the workstation that you are already using to connect with the Amazon cloud. The cloud-config user-data file that appears in the following example contains abridged SSH authorized keys to show you how to set them. \nWorking with EC2 requires Amazon accounts for both AWS and EC2 with valid payment information. If you execute the following examples, you will be charged by Amazon. You will need to replace the  for access keys and other account information in the examples with your account information. \nThe following code assumes you have installed and set up the Amazon AWS CLI and the EC2 CLI tools, including ec2-ami-tools. See Installing the AWS Command Line Interface and Setting Up the Amazon EC2 Command Line Interface Tools on Linux. Also see Setting Up the AMI Tools. \nEC2 requires an SSH key and an RSA certificate. The code in the examples  assumes that you have created SSH keys as well as an RSA user signing certificate and its corresponding private RSA key file.  \nHere's a code example that shows how to upload the Photon OS .ami image to the Amazon cloud and configure it with cloud-init. The correct virtualization type for Photon OS is hvm.   \n$ mkdir bundled\n$ tar -zxvf ./photon-ami.tar.gz \n$ ec2-bundle-image -c ec2-certificate.pem -k ec2-privatekey.pem -u   --arch x86_64 --image photon-ami.raw --destination ./bundled/\n$ aws s3 mb s3://\n$ ec2-upload-bundle --manifest ./bundled/photon-ami.manifest.xml --bucket  --access-key  --secret-key \n$ ec2-register /photon-ami.manifest.xml --name photon-ami --architecture x86_64 --virtualization-type hvm\nIn the following command, the --user-data-file option instructs cloud-init to import the cloud-config data in user-data.txt. The next command assumes you have created the keypair called mykeypair and the security group photon-sg as well as uploaded the user-data.txt file; see the EC2 documentation.\n$ ec2-run-instances  --instance-type m3.medium -g photon-sg --key mykeypair --user-data-file user-data.txt\nYou can now describe the instance to see its ID: \n$ ec2-describe-instances\nAnd you can run the following command to obtain its public IP address, which you can use to connect to the instance with SSH:\n$ aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids  --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PublicIpAddress' --output=text\n$ ec2-describe-images\nImportant: When you are done, run the following commands to terminate the machine. Because Amazon charges you while the host is running, make sure to shut it down:  \n$ ec2-deregister \n$ ec2-terminate-instances \nHere are the contents of the user-data.txt file that cloud-init applies to the machine the first time that it boots up in the cloud: \n#cloud-config\nhostname: photon-on-01\ngroups:\n- cloud-admins\n- cloud-users\nusers:\n- default\n- name: photonadmin\n   gecos: photon test admin user\n   primary-group: cloud-admins\n   groups: cloud-users\n   lock-passwd: false\n   passwd: vmware\n- name: photonuser\n   gecos: photon test user\n   primary-group: cloud-users\n   groups: users\n   passwd: vmware\npackages:\n- vim\nssh_authorized_keys:\n - ssh-rsa MIIEogIBAAKCAQEAuvHKAjBhpwuomcUTpIzJWRJAe71JyBgAWrwqyN1Mk5N+c9X5\nRu2fazFA7WxQSD1KyTEvcuf8JzdBfrEJ0v3/nT2x63pvJ8fCl6HRkZtHo8zRu8vY\nKYTZS/sdvM/ruubHfq1ldRpgtYSqbkykoe6PCQIDAQABAoIBAEgveQtjVzHDhLTr\nrmwJmO316ERfkQ/chLaElhi9qwYJG/jqlNIISWFyztqD1b3fxU6m5MOBIujh7Xpg\n... ec3test@example.com\nNow check the cloud-init output log file on EC2 at /var/log/cloud-init-output.log. \nFor more information on using cloud-init user data on EC2, see Running Commands on Your Linux Instance at Launch.\nAn article on the Photon OS GitHub wiki demonstrates how to get Photon OS up and running on EC2 and run a containerized application in the Docker engine. See Running Photon OS on Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute.\nWith Photon OS, you can also build cloud images on Google Compute Engine and other cloud providers; see Compatible Cloud Images.\nRunning a Photon OS Machine on GCE\nPhoton OS comes in a preconfigured image ready for Google Cloud Engine. This section demonstrates how to create a Photon OS instance on Google Cloud Engine with and without cloud-init user data.\nThis section assumes that you have set up a GCE account and, if you try the examples, are ready to pay Google for its cloud services. The GCE-ready version of Photon OS, however, comes for free. It is, in the parlance of Google cloud services, a private image. You can freely download it without registration from Bintray: \nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon/gce/view\nThe GCE-ready image of Photon OS contains packages and scripts that prepare it for the Google cloud to save you time as you implement a compute cluster or develop cloud applications. The GCE-ready version of Photon OS adds the following packages to the packages installed with the minimal version: \nsudo, tar, which, google-daemon, google-startup-scripts, \nkubernetes, perl-DBD-SQLite, perl-DBIx-Simple, perl, ntp\nIn addition to a GCE account, the following examples require the gcloud command-line tool; see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute.\nHere are the commands to create an instance of Photon OS from the Photon GCE image without using cloud-init. In the following commands, you must replace  with the name of your bucket. You also need to replace the path to the Photon GCE tar file. \n$ gcloud compute instances list\n$ gcloud compute images list\n$ gcloud config list\n$ gsutil mb gs://\n$ gsutil cp  gs:///photon-gce.tar.gz\n$ gcloud compute images create photon-gce-image --source-uri gs:///photon-gce.tar.gz \n$ gcloud compute instances create photon-gce-vm --machine-type \"n1-standard-1\" --image photon-gce-image\n$ gcloud compute instances describe photon-gce-vm\nNow, to create a new instance of a Photon OS machine and configure it with a cloud-init user data file, replace the gcloud compute instances create command in the example above with the following command. Before running this command, you must upload your user-data file to Google's cloud infrastructure and replace  with its path and file name. \ngcloud compute instances create photon-gce-vm --machine-type \"n1-standard-1\" --image photon-gce-vm --metadata-from-file=user-data=\nYou can also add a cloud-init user-data file to an existing instance of a Photon OS machine on GCE: \ngcloud compute instances add-metadata photon-gce-vm --metadata-from-file=user-data=\nDocker Containers\nPhoton OS includes the open source version of Docker. With Docker, Photon OS becomes a Linux run-time host for containers--that is, a Linux cloud container. A container is a process that runs on the Photon OS host with its own isolated application, file system, and networking.\nOn Photon OS, the Docker daemon is enabled by default. To view the status of the daemon, run this command: \nsystemctl status docker\nDocker is loaded and running by default on the full version of Photon OS. On the minimal version, it is loaded but not running by default, so you have to start it: \nsystemctl start docker\nTo obtain information about Docker, run this command as root: \ndocker info\nAfter you make sure that docker is enabled and started, you can, for example, run the following docker command as root to create a container running Ubuntu 14.04 with an interactive terminal shell: \ndocker run -i -t ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash\nPhoton OS also enables you to run a docker container that, in turn, runs Photon OS: \ndocker run -i -t photon /bin/bash\nKubernetes\nThe full version of Photon OS includes Kubernetes so you can manage clusters of containers. For more information, see Running Kubernetes on Photon OS.\nInstalling Sendmail\nBefore you install Sendmail, you should set the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Photon OS machine.\nNeither the full nor the minimal version of Photon OS installs Sendmail by default. When you install Sendmail, it provides Photon OS with a systemd service file that typically enables Sendmail. If, however, the service is not enabled after installation, you must enable it. \nSendmail resides in the Photon extras repository. You can install it with tdnf after setting the machine's FQDN. Here's how: \nFirst, check whether the machine's FQDN is set by running the hostnamectl status command:  \n     hostnamectl status\n   Static hostname: photon-d9ee400e194e\n         Icon name: computer-vm\n           Chassis: vm\n        Machine ID: a53b414142f944319bd0c8df6d811f36\n           Boot ID: 1f75baca8cc249f79c3794978bd82977\n    Virtualization: vmware\n  Operating System: VMware Photon/Linux\n            Kernel: Linux 4.4.8\n      Architecture: x86-64\nIn the results above, the FQDN is not set; the Photon OS machine has only a short name. If the FQDN were set, the hostname would be in its full form, typically with a domain name. \nIf the machine does not have an FQDN, set one by running hostnamectl set-hostname new-name, replacing new-name with the FQDN that you want. Example:  \n hostnamectl set-hostname photon-d9ee400e194e.corp.example.com\nThe hostnamectl status command now shows that the machine has an FQDN: \nroot@photon-d9ee400e194e [ ~ ]# hostnamectl status\n   Static hostname: photon-d9ee400e194e.corp.example.com\n         Icon name: computer-vm\n           Chassis: vm\n        Machine ID: a53b414142f944319bd0c8df6d811f36\n           Boot ID: 1f75baca8cc249f79c3794978bd82977\n    Virtualization: vmware\n  Operating System: VMware Photon/Linux\n            Kernel: Linux 4.4.8\n      Architecture: x86-64\nNext, install Sendmail: \ntdnf install sendmail\nMake sure it is enabled: \nsystemctl status sendmail\nEnable Sendmail if it's disabled and then start it: \nsystemctl enable sendmail\nsystemctl start sendmail\nFixing Sendmail If Installed Before an FQDN Was Set\nIf Sendmail is behaving improperly or if it hangs during installation, it is likely that an FQDN is not set. Take the following corrective action. \nFirst, set an FQDN for your Photon OS machine. \nThen, run the following commands in the order below: \necho $(hostname -f) > /etc/mail/local-host-names\n\ncat > /etc/mail/aliases  sendmail.cf\n\nchmod 700 /var/spool/clientmqueue\n\nchown smmsp:smmsp /var/spool/clientmqueue\nChanging the Locale\nYou can change the locale if the default locale, shown below by running the localectl command, fails to fulfill your requirements: \nlocalectl\nSystem Locale: LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n   VC Keymap: n/a\n  X11 Layout: n/a\nTo change the locale, choose the languages that you want from /usr/share/locale/locale.alias, add them to /etc/locale-gen.conf, and then regenerate the locale list by running the following command as root: \nlocale-gen.sh\nFinally, run the following command to set the new locale, replacing the example (en_US.UTF-8) with the locale that you want: \nlocalectl set-locale LANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\" LC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nThe Default Security Policy of Photon OS\nDefault Firewall Settings\nThe design of Photon OS emphasizes security. On the minimal and full versions of Photon OS, the default security policy turns on the firewall and drops packets from external interfaces and  applications. As a result, you might need to add rules to iptables to permit forwarding, allow protocols like HTTP, and open ports. In other words, you must configure the firewall for your applications and requirements. \nThe default iptables settings on the full version look like this:\niptables --list\nChain INPUT (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED\nACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:ssh\n\nChain FORWARD (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\n\nChain OUTPUT (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nTo find out how to adjust the settings, see the man page for iptables. \nAlthough the default iptables policy accepts SSH connections, the sshd configuration file on the full version of Photon OS is set to reject SSH connections. See Permitting Root Login with SSH.\nIf you are unable to ping a Photon OS machine, one of the first things you should do is check the firewall rules. Do they allow connectivity for the port and protocol in question? You can supplement the iptables commands by using lsof commands to, for instance, see the processes listening on ports: \nlsof -i -P -n\nDefault Permissions and umask\nThe umask on Photon OS is set to 0027.\nWhen you create a new file with the touch command as root, the default on Photon OS is to set the permissions to 0640--which translates to read-write for user, read for group, and no access for others. Here's an example: \ntouch newfile.md\nstat newfile.md\n  File: 'newfile.md'\n  Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file\nDevice: 801h/2049d      Inode: 316454      Links: 1\nAccess: (0640/-rw-r-----)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nWhen you create a directory as root, Photon OS sets the permissions to 0750:\nmkdir newdir\nstat newdir\n  File: 'newdir'\n  Size: 4096            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory\nDevice: 801h/2049d      Inode: 316455      Links: 2\nAccess: (0750/drwxr-x---)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nBecause the mkdir command uses the umask to modify the permissions placed on newly created files or directories, you can see umask at work in the permissions of the new directory: Its default permissions are set at 0750 after the umask subtracts 0027 from the full set of open permissions, 0777.\nSimilarly, a new file begins as 0666, which you could see if you were to set umask to 0000. But because umask is set by default to 0027, a new file's permissions are set to 0640. \nSo be aware of the default permissions on the directories and files that you create. Some system services and applications might require permissions other than the default. The systemd network service, for example, requires user-defined configuration files to be set to 644, not the default of 640. Thus, after you create a network configuration file with a .network extension, you must run the chmod command to set the new file's mode bits to 644. Example: \nchmod 644 10-static-en.network \nFor more information on permissions, see the man pages for stat, umask, and acl.\nDisabling TLS 1.0 to Improve Transport Layer Security\nPhoton OS includes GnuTLS to help secure the transport layer. GnuTLS is a library that implements the SSL and TLS protocols to secure communications. \nOn Photon OS, SSL 3.0, which contains a known vulnerability, is disabled by default. \nHowever, TLS 1.0, which also contains known vulnerabilities, is enabled by default.\nTo turn off TLS 1.0, make a directory named /etc/gnutls and then in /etc/gnutls create a file named default-priorities. In the default-priorities file, specify GnuTLS priority strings that remove TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 but retain TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2.\nAfter adding a new default-priorities file or after modifying it, you must restart all applications, including SSH, with an open TLS session for the changes to take effect.  \nHere is an example of a default-priorities file that contains GnuTLS priorities to disable TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0:  \ncat /etc/gnutls/default-priorities\nSYSTEM=NONE:!VERS-SSL3.0:!VERS-TLS1.0:+VERS-TLS1.1:+VERS-TLS1.2:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL\nThis example priority string imposes system-specific policies. The NONE keyword means that no algorithms, protocols, or compression methods are enabled, so that you can enable specific versions individually later in the string. The example priority string then specifies that SSL version 3.0 and TLS version 1.0 be removed, as marked by the exclamation point. The priority string then enables, as marked by the plus sign, versions 1.1 and 1.2 of TLS. The cypher is AES-128-CBC. The key exchange is RSA. The MAC is SHA1. And the compression algorithm is COMP-NULL.\nOn Photon OS, you can verify the system-specific policies in the default-priorities file as follows. \nConcatenate the default-priorities file to check its contents: \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# cat /etc/gnutls/default-priorities\nSYSTEM=NONE:!VERS-SSL3.0:!VERS-TLS1.0:+VERS-TLS1.1:+VERS-TLS1.2:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL\nRun the following command to check the protocols that are enabled for the system: \nroot@photon-rc [ /etc/gnutls ]# gnutls-cli --priority @SYSTEM -l\nCipher suites for @SYSTEM\nTLS_RSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA1                                0x00, 0x2f      SSL3.0\n\nCertificate types: none\nProtocols: VERS-TLS1.1, VERS-TLS1.2\nCompression: COMP-NULL\nElliptic curves: none\nPK-signatures: none\nFor information about the GnuTLS priority strings, see https://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html.\nFor information about the vulnerability in SSL 3.0, see SSL 3.0 Protocol Vulnerability and POODLE Attack.\nFor information about the vulnerabilities in TLS 1.0, see Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations.\nWorking with Repositories and Packages\nThe design of Photon OS simplifies life-cycle management and improves the security of packages. Photon OS seeks to reduce the burden and complexity of managing clusters of Linux machines by providing curated package repositories and by securing packages with GPG signatures. \nPhoton OS Package Repositories\nThe default installation of Photon OS includes four yum-compatible repositories plus the repository on the Photon OS ISO when it's available in a CD-ROM drive:  \nls /etc/yum.repos.d/\nlightwave.repo\nphoton-extras.repo\nphoton-iso.repo\nphoton-updates.repo\nphoton.repo \nThe Photon ISO repository (photon-iso.repo) contains the installation packages for Photon OS. All the packages that Photon builds and publishes reside in the RPMs directory of the ISO when it is mounted. The RPMs directory contains metadata that lets it act as a yum repository. Mounting the ISO gives you all the packages corresponding to a Photon OS build. If, however, you built Photon OS yourself from the source code, the packages correspond only to your build, though they will typically be the latest. In contrast, the ISO that you obtain from the Bintray web site contains only the packages that are in the ISO at the point of publication. As a result, the packages may no longer match those on Bintray, which are updated regularly.  \nThe main Photon OS repository (photon.repo) contains all the packages that are built from the ISO or from another source. This repository points to a static batch of packages and spec files at the point of a release. \nThe updates repository (photon-updates.repo) is irrelevant to a major release until after the release is installed. Thereafter, the updates repository holds the updated packages for that release. The repository, that is, points to updates for the installed version, such as a version of Kubernetes that supersedes the version installed during the major release. \nThe Photon extras repository (photon-extras.repo) holds Likewise Open, an open source authentication engine, and other VMware software that you can add to Photon OS for free. Photon OS supports but does not build the packages in the extras repository.Similarly, the Lightwave repository (lightwave.repo) contains the packages that make up the VMware Lightwave security suite for cloud applications, including tools for identity management, access control, and certificate management.\nExamining Signed Packages\nPhoton OS signs its packages and repositories with GPG signatures to bolster security. The GPG signature uses keyed-hash authentication method codes, typically the SHA1 algorithm and an MD5 checksum, to simultaneously verify the integrity and authentication of a package. A keyed-hash message authentication code combines a cryptographic hash function with a secret cryptographic key.\nIn Photon OS, GPG signature verification automatically takes place when you install or update a package with the default package manager, tdnf. The default setting in the tdnf configuration file for checking the GPG is set to 1, for true:  \ncat /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf\n[main]\ngpgcheck=1\ninstallonly_limit=3\nclean_requirements_on_remove=true\nrepodir=/etc/yum.repos.d\ncachedir=/var/cache/tdnf\nOn Photon OS, you can view the key with which VMware signs packages by running the following command:  \nrpm -qa gpg-pubkey*\nThe command returns the GPG public key:\ngpg-pubkey-66fd4949-4803fe57\nOnce you have the name of the key, you can view information about the key with the rpm -qi command, as the following abridged output demonstrates: \nrpm -qi gpg-pubkey-66fd4949-4803fe57\nName        : gpg-pubkey\nVersion     : 66fd4949\nRelease     : 4803fe57\nArchitecture: (none)\nInstall Date: Thu Jun 16 11:51:39 2016\nGroup       : Public Keys\nSize        : 0\nLicense     : pubkey\nSignature   : (none)\nSource RPM  : (none)\nBuild Date  : Tue Apr 15 01:01:11 2008\nBuild Host  : localhost\nRelocations : (not relocatable)\nPackager    : VMware, Inc. -- Linux Packaging Key -- \nSummary     : gpg(VMware, Inc. -- Linux Packaging Key -- )\nDescription :\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nVersion: rpm-4.11.2 (NSS-3)\nmI0ESAP+VwEEAMZylR8dOijUPNn3He3GdgM/kOXEhn3uQl+sRMNJUDm1qebi2D5b ...\nIf you have one of the RPMs from Photon OS on another Linux system, such as Ubuntu, you can check the status of the SHA and MD5 for the package to verify that it has not been tampered with:\nrpm -K /home/steve/workspace/photon/stage/SRPMS/kubernetes-1.1.8-4.ph1.src.rpm\n/home/steve/workspace/photon/stage/SRPMS/kubernetes-1.1.8-4.ph1.src.rpm: sha1 md5 OK\nAnd then you can view the SHA1 digest and the MD5 digest by running the following command: \nrpm -Kv /home/steve/workspace/photon/stage/SRPMS/kubernetes-1.1.8-4.ph1.src.rpm\n/home/steve/workspace/photon/stage/SRPMS/kubernetes-1.1.8-4.ph1.src.rpm:\nHeader SHA1 digest: OK (89b55443d4c9f67a61ae0c1ec9bf4ece2d6aa32b)\n        MD5 digest: OK (51eee659a8730e25fd2a52aff9a6c2c2)\nThe above examples show that the Kubernetes package has not been tampered with.\nBuilding a Package from a Source RPM\nThis section describes how to install and build a package on the full version of Photon OS from the package's source RPM. You obtain the source RPMs that Photon OS uses from Bintray: \nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon\nTo build a package from its source RPM, or SRPM, Photon OS requires the following packages:  \n\nrpmbuild. This package is installed by default on the full version of Photon OS, so you should not have to install it. \ngcc. This package is also installed by default on the full version of Photon OS, so you should not have to install it. \nmake, Cmake, automake, or another make package, depending on the package you are trying to install and build from its source RPM. Cmake is installed by default on Photon OS. You can install other make packages if need be by using tdnf or yum.  \n\nAnother requirement is a local unprivileged user account other than the root account. You should build RPMs as an unprivileged user. Do not build a package as root--building an RPM with the root account might damage your system. \nIf you are building a package on a virtual machine running Photon OS in VMware vSphere, VMware Workstation, or VMware Fusion, take a snapshot of your virtual machine before building the package. \nVMware recommends that you install and build packages from their source RPMs on the full version of Photon OS. Do not use the minimal version to work with source RPMs.  \nHere's how to install and build an example package--sed, in this case--from its source RPM on Photon OS with an unprivileged account. \nFirst, check whether rpmbuild is installed by running the following command: \nrpmbuild --version\nIf it is not installed, install it by running the following command as root: \ntdnf install rpm-build\nSecond, create the directories for building RPMs under your local user account's home directory (not under root):\nmkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}\nNext, create a .rpmmacros file under your home directory and override the default location of the RPM building tree with the new one. This command overwrites an existing .rpmmacros file. Before running the following command, make sure you do not already have a .rpmmacros file; if a .rpmmacros file exists, back it up under a new name in case you want to restore it later. \necho '%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild' > ~/.rpmmacros\nNow place the source RPM file that you want to install and build in the /tmp directory. \nTo install the source file, run the following command with your unprivileged user account, replacing the sed example source RPM with the name of the one that you want to install: \nrpm -i /tmp/sed-4.2.2-2.ph1.src.rpm\nThe above command unpacks the source RPM and places its .spec file in your ~/rpmbuild/SPECS directory. In the next step, the rpmbuild tool uses the .spec file to build the RPM. \nTo build the RPM, run the following commands with your unprivileged user account. Again, replace the sed.spec example file with the name of the .spec file that you want to build. \ncd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS\nrpmbuild -ba sed.spec\nIf successful, the rpmbuild -ba command builds the RPM and generates an RPM package file in your ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64 directory. Example:\nls RPMS/x86_64/\nsed-4.2.2-2.x86_64.rpm  sed-debuginfo-4.2.2-2.x86_64.rpm  sed-lang-4.2.2-2.x86_64.rpm\nThe rpmbuild command also generates a new SRPM file and saves it in your ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS directory. Example:  \nls SRPMS/\nsed-4.2.2-2.src.rpm\nIf the rpmbuild command is unsuccessful with an error that it cannot find a library, you must install the RPMs for the library that your source RPM depends on before you can successfully build your source RPM. Iterate through installing the libraries that your source RPM relies on until you can successfully build it. \nTo install the RPM, run the following command with your unprivileged user account:  \nrpm -i RPMS/x86_64/sed-4.2.2-2.x86_64.rpm\nCompiling C++ Code on the Minimal Version of Photon OS\nAs a minimalist Linux run-time environment, the minimal version of Photon OS lacks the packages that you need to compile the code for a C++ program. For example, without the requisite packages, trying to compile the file containing the following code with the gcc command will generate errors: \n#include \nint main()\n{\nreturn 0;\n}\nThe errors look something like this: \ngcc test.c\n-bash: gcc: command not found\ntdnf install gcc -y\ngcc test.c\ntest.c:1:19: fatal error: stdio.h: No such file or directory\ncompilation terminated.\nTo enable the minimal version of Photon OS to preprocess, compile, assemble, and link C++ code, you must install the following packages as root with tdnf:\n\ngcc\nglibc-devel\nbinutils\n\nHere's the tdnf command to install these packages: \ntdnf install gcc glibc-devel binutils\nReferences\n\nPhoton OS Troubleshooting Guide.\n\nThe following technical articles and guides appear in the Photon OS wiki: \n\nFAQ\nRunning Photon OS on vSphere\nRunning Photon OS on Fusion\nInstall and Configure a Swarm Cluster with DNS Service on Photon OS\nInstall and Configure a Production Ready Mesos Cluster on Photon OS\nInstall and Configure Marathon for Mesos Cluster on Photon OS\nInstall and Configure DCOS CLI for Mesos\nInstall and Configure Mesos DNS on a Mesos Cluster\n\n"},"photon-os-troubleshooting-guide.html":{"url":"photon-os-troubleshooting-guide.html","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"Photon OS Linux Troubleshooting Guide\n\nIntroduction\nSystemd and TDNF\nThe Root Account and the sudo and su\nCommands\nChecking the Version and Build\nNumber\nGeneral Best Practices\nLogs on Photon OS\nTroubleshooting Progression\n\n\nSolutions to Common Problems\nResetting a Lost Root\nPassword\nFixing Permissions on Network Config\nFiles\nPermitting Root Login with\nSSH\nFixing Sendmail If Installed Before an FQDN Was\nSet\n\n\nCommon Troubleshooting Tools on Photon\nOS\nTop\nps\nnetstat\nfind\nLocate\ndf\nmd5sum and sha256sum\nstrace\nfile\nstat\nwatch\nvmstat and fdisk\nlsof\nfuser\nldd\ngdb\nOther Troubleshooting Tools Installed by\nDefault\nInstalling More Tools from\nRepositories\nLinux Troubleshooting Tools Not on Photon\nOS\n\n\nSystemd\nViewing Services\nUsing Systemd Commands Instead of Init.d\nCommands\nAnalyzing System Logs with\njournalctl\nInspecting Services with\nsystemd-analyze\n\n\nNetworking\nManaging the Network\nConfiguration\nUse ip and ss Commands Instead of ifconfig and\nnetstat\nInspecting the Status of Network Links with\nnetworkctl\nTurning on Network\nDebugging\nInstalling the Packages for tcpdump and netcat with\ntdnf\nChecking Firewall Rules\nNetmgr\n\n\nFile System\nChecking Disk Space\nAdding a Disk and Partitioning\nIt\nExpanding Disk Partition\nfdisk\nfsck\nFixing File System Errors When fsck\nFails\n\n\nPackages\nKernel Problems and Boot and Login\nProblems\nKernel Overview\nBoot Process Overview\nBlank Screen on Reboot\nInvestigating Strange\nBehavior\nInvestigating the Guest Kernel When You Cannot Log\nOn\nKernel Log Replication with\nVProbes\n\n\nPerformance Issues\n\nIntroduction\nThis guide describes the fundamentals of troubleshooting problems on Photon OS. An open-source minimalist Linux operating system from VMware, Photon OS is optimized for cloud computing platforms, VMware vSphere deployments, virtual appliances, and applications native to the cloud.\nThis guide covers the basics of troubleshooting systemd, packages, network interfaces, services such as SSH and Sendmail, the file system, and the Linux kernel. The guide includes a quick tour of the tools that you can use for troubleshooting and provides examples along the way. The guide also demonstrates how to access the system's log files. \nFor information on how to install and manage Photon OS, see the Photon OS Administration Guide.\nSystemd and TDNF\nTwo characteristics of Photon OS stand out: It manages services with systemd, and it manages packages with its own open source, yum-compatible package manager called tdnf, for Tiny DNF. \nBy using systemd, Photon OS adopts a contemporary Linux standard to bootstrap the user space and concurrently start services--an architecture that differs from traditional Linux systems such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11.\n \nA traditional Linux system contains an initialization system called SysVinit. With SLES 11, for instance, SysVinit-style init programs control how the system starts up and shuts down. Init implements system runlevels. A SysVinit runlevel defines a state in which a process or service runs. In contrast to a SysVinit system, systemd defines no such runlevels. Instead, systemd uses a dependency tree of targets to determine which services to start when.\nBecause the systemd commands differ from those of an init.d-based Linux system, a section later in this guide illustrates how to troubleshoot by using systemctl commands instead of init.d-style commands. \nTdnf keeps the operating system as small as possible while preserving yum's robust package-management capabilities. On Photon OS, tdnf is the default package manager for installing new packages. Since troubleshooting with tdnf differs from using yum, a later section of this guide describes how to solve problems with packages and repositories by using tdnf commands.\nThe Root Account and the sudo and su Commands\nThis guide assumes that you are logged in to Photon OS with the root account and running commands as root. The sudo program comes with the full version of Photon OS. On the minimal version, you must install sudo with tdnf if you want to use it. As an alternative to installing sudo on the minimal version, you can switch users as needed with the su command to run commands that require root privileges.\nChecking the Version and Build Number\nTo check the version and build number of Photon OS, concatenate /etc/photon-release. Example: \ncat /etc/photon-release\nVMware Photon Linux 1.0\nPHOTON_BUILD_NUMBER=a6f0f63\nThe build number in the results maps to the commit number on the VMware Photon OS GitHub commits page.\nGeneral Best Practices\nWhen troubleshooting, you should follow some general best practices:\n\nTake a snapshot. Before you do anything to a virtual machine running Photon OS, take a snapshot of the VM so that you can restore it if need be. \n\nMake a backup copy. Before you change a configuration file, make a copy of the original in case you need to restore it later; example: cp /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf.orig\n\nCollect logs. Save the log files associated with a Photon OS problem; you or others might need them later. Include not only the log files on the guest but also the vmware.log file on the host; vmware.log is in the host's directory that contains the VM.\n\nKnow what's in your toolbox. Glance at the man page for a tool before you use it so that you know what your options are. The options can help focus the command's output on the problem you're trying to solve.\n\nUnderstand the system. The more you know about the operating system and how it works, the better you can troubleshoot.\n\n\nLogs on Photon OS\nOn Photon OS, all the system logs except the installation log and the cloud-init log are written into the systemd journal. The journalctl command queries the contents of the systemd journal.\nThe installation log files and the cloud-init log files reside in /var/log. If Photon OS is running on a virtual machine in a VMware hypervisor, the log file for the VMware tools (vmware-vmsvc.log) also resides in /var/log. \nTroubleshooting Progression\nIf you encounter a problem running an application or appliance on Photon OS and you suspect it involves the operating system, you can troubleshoot by proceeding as follows. \nFirst, check the services running on Photon OS:\nsystemctl status\nSecond, check your application's log files for clues. (For VMware applications, see Location of Log Files for VMware Products.)\nThird, check the service controller or service monitor for your application or appliance. \nFourth, check the network interfaces and other aspects of the network service with systemd-network commands.\nFifth, check the operating system's log files: \njournalctl\nNext, run the following commands to view all services according to the order in which they were started:\nsystemd-analyze critical-chain \nFinally, if the previous steps have not revealed enough information to isolate the problem, turn to the troubleshooting tool that you think is most likely to help with the issue at hand. You could, for example, use strace to identify the location of the failure. See the list of troubleshooting tools on Photon OS in a later section. \nSolutions to Common Problems\nThis section describes solutions to problems that you're likely to encounter.\nResetting a Lost Root Password\nHere's how to reset a lost root password. \nFirst, restart the Photon OS machine or the virtual machine running Photon OS. When the Photon OS splash screen appears as it restarts, type the letter e to go to the GNU GRUB edit menu. Be quick about it: Because Photon OS reboots so quickly, you won't have much time to type e. Remember that in vSphere and Workstation, you might have to give the console focus by clicking in its window before it will register input from the keyboard. \nSecond, in the GNU GRUB edit menu, go to the end of the line that starts with linux, add a space, and then add the following code exactly as it appears below:\nrw init=/bin/bash\nAfter you add this code, the GNU GRUB edit menu should look exactly like this:\n \nNow type F10.\nAt the command prompt, type passwd and then type (and re-enter) a new root password that conforms to the password complexity rules of Photon OS. Remember the password. \nNext, type the following command:\numount /\nFinally, type the following command. You must include the -f option to force a reboot; otherwise, the kernel enters a state of panic.\nreboot -f\nThis sequence of commands should look like this:\n\nAfter the Photon OS machine reboots, log in with the new root password. \nFixing Permissions on Network Config Files\nIf you, as the root user, create a new network configuration file on Photon OS, the network service might be unable to process it until you set the file's mode bits to 644.\nIf you query the journal with journalctl -u systemd-networkd, you might see the following error message along with an indication that the network service did not start: \ncould not load configuration files. permission denied\nThe permissions on the network files are the likely cause of this problem. Without the correct permissions, networkd-systemd cannot parse and apply the settings, and the network configuration that you created will not be loaded. \nAfter you create a network configuration file with a .network extension, you must run the chmod command to set the new file's mode bits to 644. Example: \nchmod 644 10-static-en.network\nFor Photon OS to apply the new configuration, you must restart the systemd-networkd service by running the following command: \nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nPermitting Root Login with SSH\nThe full version of Photon OS prevents root login with SSH by default. To permit root login over SSH, open /etc/ssh/sshd_config with the vim text editor and set PermitRootLogin to yes. \nVim is the default text editor available in both the full and minimal versions of Photon OS. (Nano is also in the full version.) After you modify the SSH daemon's configuration file, you must restart the sshd daemon for the changes to take effect. Example: \nvim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n# override default of no subsystems\nSubsystem       sftp    /usr/libexec/sftp-server\n\n# Example of overriding settings on a per-user basis\n#Match User anoncvs\n#       X11Forwarding no\n#       AllowTcpForwarding no\n#       PermitTTY no\n#       ForceCommand cvs server\nPermitRootLogin yes\nUsePAM yes\nSave your changes in vim and then restart the sshd daemon: \nsystemctl restart sshd\nYou can then connect to the Photon OS machine with the root account over SSH:\nsteve@ubuntu:~$ ssh root@198.51.100.131\nFixing Sendmail If Installed Before an FQDN Was Set\nIf Sendmail is behaving improperly or if it hangs during installation, it is likely that an FQDN is not set. Take the following corrective action. \nFirst, set an FQDN for your Photon OS machine. \nThen, run the following commands in the order below: \necho $(hostname -f) > /etc/mail/local-host-names\n\ncat > /etc/mail/aliases  sendmail.cf\n\nchmod 700 /var/spool/clientmqueue\n\nchown smmsp:smmsp /var/spool/clientmqueue\nCommon Troubleshooting Tools on Photon OS\nThis section describes tools that can help troubleshoot problems. These tools are installed by default on the full version of Photon OS. On the minimal version of Photon OS, you may have to install a tool before you can use it. \nThere is a manual, or man page, on Photon OS for all the tools covered in this section. The man pages provide more information about each tool's commands, options, and output. To view a tool's man page, on the Photon OS command line, type man and then the name of the tool. Example: \nman strace\nSome of the examples in this section are marked as abridged with ellipsis (...).\nTop\nPhoton OS includes the Top tool to monitor system resources, workloads, and performance. It can unmask problems caused by processes or applications overconsuming CPUs, time, or RAM. \nTo view a textual display of resource consumption, run the top command: \ntop\nIn Top, you can kill a runaway or stalled process by typing k followed by its process ID (PID). \n\nIf the percent of CPU utilization is consistently high with little idle time, there might be a runaway process overconsuming CPUs. Restarting the service might solve the problem. \nA handy trick while troubleshooting an unknown issue is to run Top in the background by using batch mode to write its output to a file in order to collect data about performance:\ntop d 120 b >> top120second.output\nFor a list of options that filter top output and other information, see the man page for Top.\nps\nThe ps tool shows the processes running on the machine. The ps tool derives flexibility and power from its options, all of which are covered in the tool's Photon OS man page:\nman ps\nHere are several popular invocations of ps for troubleshooting. \nShow processes by user: \nps aux\nShow processes and child processes by user: \nps auxf\nShow processes containing the string ssh:\nps aux | grep ssh\nShow processes and the command and options with which they were started: \nps auxww\nExample abridged output: \nps auxww\nUSER        PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nroot          1  0.0  0.9  32724  3300 ?        Ss   07:51   0:32 /lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize 22\nnetstat\nThe netstat command can identify bottlenecks causing  performance issues. It lists network connections, listening sockets, port information, and interface statistics for different protocols. Examples: \nnetstat --statistics\nnetstat --listening\nfind\nThe find command can be a useful starting point to troubleshoot a Photon OS machine that has stopped working. The following command, for example, lists the files in the root directory that have changed in the past day: \n    find / -mtime -1 \nSee the find manual. Take note of the security considerations listed in the find manual if you are using find to troubleshoot an appliance running on Photon OS. \nLocate\nThe locate command is a fast way to find files and directories when all you have is a keyword. Similar to find and part of the same findutils package preinstalled on the full version of Photon OS by default, the locate command finds file names in the file names database. Before you can use locate accurately, you should update its database: \nupdatedb\nThen you can run locate to quickly find a file, such as any file name containing .network, which can be helpful to see all the system's .network configuration files; abridged example: \nlocate .network\n/etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.freedesktop.network1.conf\n/etc/systemd/network/10-dhcp-en.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-host0.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-ve.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/system/busnames.target.wants/org.freedesktop.network1.busname\n/usr/lib/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service\n/usr/lib/systemd/system/org.freedesktop.network1.busnname\n/usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/org.freedesktop.network1.service\nThe locate command is also a quick way to see whether a troubleshooting tool is installed on Photon OS. Examples: \nlocate strace\n/usr/bin/strace\n/usr/bin/strace-graph\n/usr/bin/strace-log-merge\n/usr/share/man/man1/strace.1.gz\n/usr/share/vim/vim74/syntax/strace.vim\n\nlocate traceroute\nThe strace tool is there but traceroute is not. You can, however, quickly install traceroute from the Photon OS repository: \ntdnf install traceroute\ndf\nThe df command reports the disk space available on the file system. Because running out of disk space can lead an application to fail, a quick check of the available space makes sense as an early troubleshooting step: \ndf -h\nThe -h option prints out the available and used space in human-readable sizes. After checking the space, you should also check the number of available inodes. Too few available inodes can lead to difficult-to-diagnose problems:\ndf -i\nmd5sum and sha256sum\nmd5sum calculates 128-bit MD5 hashes--a message digest, or digital signature, of a file--to uniquely identify a file and verify its integrity after file transfers, downloads, or disk errors when the security of the file is not in question. Photon OS also includes sha256sum, which is the preferred method of calculating the authenticity of a file to prevent tampering when security is a concern. Photon OS also includes shasum, sha1sum, sha384sum, and sha512sum. See the man pages for  md3sum, sha256sum, and the other SHA utilities. \nmd5sum can help troubleshooting installation issues by verifying that the version of Photon OS being installed matches the version on the Bintray download page. If, for instance, bytes were dropped during the download, the checksums will not match. Try downloading it again. \nstrace\nThe strace utility follows system calls and signals as they are executed so that you can see what an application, command, or process is doing. strace can trace failed commands, identify where a process obtains its configuration, monitor file activity, and find the location of a crash. \nBy tracing system calls, strace can help troubleshoot a broad range of problems, including issues with input-output, memory, interprocess communication, network usage, and application performance. \nFor troubleshooting a problem that gives off few or no clues, the following command displays every system call: \nstrace ls -al\nWith strace commands, you can route the output to a file to make it easier to analyze: \nstrace -o output.txt ls -al\nstrace can reveal the files that an application is trying to open with the -eopen option. This combination can help troubleshoot an application that is failing because it is missing files or being denied access to a file it needs. If, for example, you see \"No such file or directory\" in the results of strace -eopen, something might be wrong: \nstrace -eopen sshd\nopen(\"/usr/lib/x86_64/libpam.so.0\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nopen(\"/usr/lib/libpam.so.0\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\nIn the results above, it's OK that the first file is missing because it is found in the next line. In other cases, the application might be unable to open one of its configuration files or reading the wrong one. If the results say \"permission denied\" for one of the files, check the permissions of the file with ls -l or stat.   \nWhen troubleshooting with strace, you can include the process ID in its commands. Here's an example of how to find a process ID: \nps -ef | grep apache\nAnd you can then use strace to examine the file a process is working with: \nstrace -e trace=file -p 1719\nA similar command can trace network traffic: \nstrace -p 812 -e trace=network\nIf an application is crashing, use strace to trace the application and then analyze what happens right before the application crashes.\nYou can also trace the child processes that an application spawns with the fork system call, and you can do so with systemctl commands that start a process to identify why an application crashes immediately or fails to start: \nstrace -f -o output.txt systemctl start httpd\nHere's another example. If journalctl is showing that networkd is failing, you can run strace to help determine why: \nstrace -o output.txt systemctl restart systemd-networkd\nAnd then grep inside the results for something, such as exit or error: \ngrep exit output.txt\nMaybe the results indicate systemd-resolved is going wrong, and you can then strace it, too: \nstrace -f -o output.txt systemctl restart systemd-resolved\nfile\nThe file command determines the file type, which can help troubleshoot problems when an application mistakes one type of file for another, leading it to misbehave. Example: \nfile /usr/sbin/sshd\n/usr/sbin/sshd: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, stripped\nstat\nThe stat command can help troubleshoot problems with files or the file system by showing the last date it was modified and other information. Example:  \nstat /dev/sda1\nFile: '/dev/sda1'\nSize: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   block special file\nDevice: 6h/6d   Inode: 6614        Links: 1     Device type: 8,1\nAccess: (0660/brw-rw----)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    8/    disk)\nAccess: 2016-09-02 12:23:56.135999936 +0000\nModify: 2016-09-02 12:23:52.879999981 +0000\nChange: 2016-09-02 12:23:52.879999981 +0000\nBirth: -\nOn Photon OS, stat is handy to show permissions for a file or directory in both their absolute octal notation and their read-write-execute abbreviation; truncated example: \nchmod 777 tester.md\nstat tester.md\n  File: 'tester.md'\n  Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file\nDevice: 801h/2049d      Inode: 316385      Links: 1\nAccess: (0777/-rwxrwxrwx)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nwatch\nThe watch utility runs a command at regular intervals so you can observe how its output changes over time. watch can help dynamically monitor network links, routes, and other information when you are troubleshooting networking or performance issues. Examples: \nwatch -n0 --differences ss\nwatch -n1 --differences ip route\nHere's another example with a screenshot of the command's output. This command monitors the traffic on your network links. The highlighted numbers are updated every second so you can see the traffic fluctuating: \nwatch -n1 --differences ip -s link show up\n  \nvmstat and fdisk\nThe vmstat tool displays statistics about virtual memory, processes, block input-output, disks, and CPU activity. This tool can help diagnose performance problems, especially system bottlenecks.  \nIts output on a Photon OS virtual machine running in VMware Workstation 12 Pro without a heavy load looks like this: \nvmstat\nprocs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----\n r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st\n 0  0      0   5980  72084 172488    0    0    27    44  106  294  1  0 98  1  0\nWhat do all these codes mean? They are explained in the vmstat man page. \nIf r, the number of runnable processes, is higher than 10, the machine is under stress; consider intervening to reduce the number of processes or to distribute some of the processes to other machines. In other words, the machine has a bottleneck in executing processes.\nIf cs, the number of context switches per second, is really high, there may be too many jobs running on the machine. \nIf in, the number of interrupts per second, is relatively high, there might be a bottleneck for network or disk IO. \nYou can investigate disk IO further by using vmstat's -d option to report disk statistics; abridged example on a machine with little load: \nvmstat -d\ndisk- ------------reads------------ ------------writes----------- -----IO------\n       total merged sectors      ms  total merged sectors      ms    cur    sec\nram0       0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nram1       0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nloop0      0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nloop1      0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nsr0        0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nsda    22744    676  470604   12908  72888  24949  805224  127692      0    130\nThe -D option summarizes disk statistics:\nvmstat -D\n           26 disks\n            2 partitions\n        22744 total reads\n          676 merged reads\n       470604 read sectors\n        12908 milli reading\n        73040 writes\n        25001 merged writes\n       806872 written sectors\n       127808 milli writing\n            0 inprogress IO\n          130 milli spent IO\nYou can also get statistics about a partition. First, run the fdisk -l command to list the machine's devices. Then run vmstat -p with the name of a device to view its stats: \nfdisk -l\nDisk /dev/ram0: 4 MiB, 4194304 bytes, 8192 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\n...\nDevice        Start      End  Sectors Size Type\n/dev/sda1      2048 16771071 16769024   8G Linux filesystem\n/dev/sda2  16771072 16777182     6111   3M BIOS boot\n\nvmstat -p /dev/sda1\nsda1          reads   read sectors  writes    requested writes\n               22579     473306      78510     866088\nSee the vmstat man page for more options. \nlsof\nThe lsof command lists open files. And this tool's definition of an open file is quite broad--directories, libraries, streams, domain sockets, and Internet sockets are all considered files, making lsof broadly applicable as a mid-level troubleshooting tool to identify the files a process is using. Because a Linux system like Photon OS uses files to do its work, you can run lsof as root to see how the system is using them and to see how an application works. \nIf, for example, you cannot unmount a disk because it is in use, you can run lsof to identify the files on the disk that are being used. Here's an example showing what's using the root directory: \nlsof /root\nCOMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF   NODE NAME\nbash       879 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nbash      1265 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nsftp-serv 1326 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\ngdb       1351 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nbash      1395 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nlsof      1730 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nYou can do the same with an application or virtual appliance by running lsof with the user name or process ID of the app. Here's an example that lists the open files used by the Apache HTTP Server:  \nlsof -u apache\nRunning the command with the -i option lists all the open network and Internet files, which can help troubleshoot network problems: \nlsof -i\nSee the Unix socket addresses of a user like zookeeper: \nlsof -u zookeeper -U\nAnd here's an example that shows the processes running on Ports 1 through 80:\nlsof -i TCP:1-80\nCOMMAND  PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nhttpd    403   root    3u  IPv6  10733      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd    407 apache    3u  IPv6  10733      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd    408 apache    3u  IPv6  10733      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd    409 apache    3u  IPv6  10733      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nsshd     820   root    3u  IPv4  11336      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN)\nsshd     820   root    4u  IPv6  11343      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN)\nsshd    1258   root    3u  IPv4  48040      0t0  TCP 198.51.100.143:ssh->198.51.100.1:49759 (ESTABLISHED)\nsshd    1319   root    3u  IPv4  50866      0t0  TCP 198.51.100.143:ssh->198.51.100.1:51054 (ESTABLISHED)\nsshd    1388   root    3u  IPv4  56438      0t0  TCP 198.51.100.143:ssh->198.51.100.1:60335 (ESTABLISHED)\nYou can also inspect the files opened by a process ID. Here's a truncated example that queries the files open by the systemd network service: \nlsof -p 1917\nCOMMAND    PID            USER   FD      TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF   NODE NAME\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network  cwd       DIR                8,1     4096      2 /\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network  txt       REG                8,1   887896 272389 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-networkd\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network  mem       REG                8,1   270680 262267 /usr/lib/libnss_files-2.22.so\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    0r      CHR                1,3      0t0   5959 /dev/null\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    1u     unix 0x0000000000000000      0t0  45734 type=STREAM\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    3u  netlink                         0t0   6867 ROUTE\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    4u     unix 0x0000000000000000      0t0  45744 type=DGRAM\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    9u  netlink                         0t0  45754 KOBJECT_UEVENT\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network   12u  a_inode               0,11        0   5955 [timerfd]\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network   13u     IPv4             104292      0t0    UDP 198.51.100.143:bootpc\nfuser\nThe fuser command identifies the process IDs of processes using files or sockets. The term process is, in this case, synonymous with user. To identify the process ID of a process using a socket, run fuser with its namespace option and specify tcp or udp and the name of the process or port. Examples: \nfuser -n tcp ssh\nssh/tcp:               940  1308\nfuser -n tcp http\nhttp/tcp:              592   594   595   596\nfuser -n tcp 80\n80/tcp:                592   594   595   596\nldd\nBy revealing the shared libraries that a program depends on, ldd can help troubleshoot an application that is missing a library or finding the wrong one.\nIf, for example, you find output that says \"file not found,\" check the path to the library.  \nldd /usr/sbin/sshd\nlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc0e3e3000)\nlibpam.so.0 => (file not found)\nlibcrypto.so.1.0.0 => /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 (0x00007f624e570000)\nYou can also use the objdump command to show dependencies for a program's object files; example:\nobjdump -p /usr/sbin/sshd | grep NEEDED\ngdb\nThe gdb tool is the GNU debugger. It lets you peer inside a program while it executes or when it crashes so that you can catch bugs on the fly. The gdb tool is typically used to debug programs written in C and C++. On Photon OS, gdb can help you determine why an application crashed. See the man page for gdb for instructions on how to run it. For an extensive example on how to use gdb to troubleshoot Photon OS running on a VM when you cannot login to Photon OS, see the section on troubleshooting boot and logon problems. \nOther Troubleshooting Tools Installed by Default\nThe following troubleshooting tools are included in the full version of Photon OS: \n\ngrep searches files for patterns. \nping tests network connectivity. \nstrings displays the characters in a file to identify its contents.\nlsmod lists loaded modules.\nipcs shows data about the inter-process communication (IPC) resources to which a process has read access--typically, shared memory segments, message queues, and semaphore arrays.\nnm lists symbols from object files. \ndiff compares files side by side. Useful to compare two configuration files when one version works and the other doesn't. \n\nInstalling More Tools from Repositories\nYou can install several troubleshooting tools from the Photon OS repositories by using the default package management system, tdnf. \nIf a tool you need is not installed, the first thing you should do is search the repositories to see whether it's available. The traceroute tool, for example, is not installed by default. Here's how to search for it in the repositories:  \ntdnf search traceroute\ntraceroute : Traces the route taken by packets over an IPv4/IPv6 network\nThe results of the above command show that traceroute exists in the repository. You install it with tdnf: \ntdnf install traceroute\nAdditional tools are not installed by default but are in the repository for instant installation with tdnf: \n\nnet-tools: networking tools.\nltrace: tool for intercepting and recording dynamic library calls. It can identify the function an application was calling when it crashed, making it useful for debugging.\nnfs-utils: client tools for the kernel Network File System, or NFS, including showmount; installed by default in the full version of Photon OS but not in the minimal version. \npcstat: A tool that inspects which pages of a file or files are being cached by the Linux kernel.\nsysstat and sar: Utilities to monitor system performance and usage activity. Installing sysstat also installs sar.\nsystemtap and crash: The systemtap utility is a programmable instrumentation system for diagnosing problems of performance or function. Installing systemtap also installs crash, which is a kernel crash analysis utility for live systems and dump files.\ndstat: versatile tool for viewing and analyzing statistics about system resources.\n\nThe dstat tool, for example, can help troubleshoot system performance. The tool shows a live, running list of statistics about system resources: \ndstat\nYou did not select any stats, using -cdngy by default.\n----total-cpu-usage---- -dsk/total- -net/total- ---paging-- ---system--\nusr sys idl wai hiq siq| read  writ| recv  send|  in   out | int   csw\n  1   0  98   1   0   0|4036B   42k|   0     0 |   0     0 |  95   276\n  1   0  98   1   0   0|   0    64k|  60B  940B|   0     0 | 142   320\n  1   1  98   0   0   0|   0    52k|  60B  476B|   0     0 | 149   385\nLinux Troubleshooting Tools Not on Photon OS\nThe following Linux troubleshoot tools are neither installed on Photon OS by default nor available in the Photon OS repositories: \n\niostat\ntelnet (use SSH instead)\nIprm\nhdparm\nsyslog (use journalctl instead)\nddd\nksysmoops\nxev\nGUI tools (because Photon OS has no GUI)\n\nSystemd\nPhoton OS manages services with systemd and its command-line utility for inspecting and controlling the system, systemctl, not the deprecated commands of init.d. For example, instead of running the /etc/init.d/ssh script to stop and start the OpenSSH server on a init.d-based Linux system, you control the service by running the following systemctl commands on Photon OS: \nsystemctl stop sshd\nsystemctl start sshd\nFor an overview of systemd, see systemd System and Service Manager and the man page for systemd. The systemd man pages are listed at https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/.\nViewing Services\nTo view a description of all the active, loaded units, execute the systemctl command without any options or arguments: \nsystemctl\nTo see all the loaded, active, and inactive units and their description, run this command: \nsystemctl --all\nTo see all the unit files and their current status but no description, run this command: \nsystemctl list-unit-files\nThe grep command filters the services by a search term, a helpful tactic to recall the exact name of a unit file without looking through a long list of names. Example: \nsystemctl list-unit-files | grep network\norg.freedesktop.network1.busname           static\ndbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service      enabled\nsystemd-networkd-wait-online.service       enabled\nsystemd-networkd.service                   enabled\nsystemd-networkd.socket                    enabled\nnetwork-online.target                      static\nnetwork-pre.target                         static\nnetwork.target  \nUsing Systemd Commands Instead of Init.d Commands\nBasic system administration commands on Photon OS differ from those on operating systems that use SysVinit. Since Photon OS uses systemd instead of SysVinit, you must use systemd commands to manage services. \nFor example, to list all the services that you can manage on Photon OS, you run the following command instead of ls /etc/rc.d/init.d/: \nsystemctl list-unit-files --type=service\nSimilarly, to check whether the sshd service is enabled, on Photon OS you run the following command instead of chkconfig sshd:\nsystemctl is-enabled sshd\nThe chkconfig --list command that shows which services are enabled for which runlevel on a SysVinit computer becomes substantially different on Photon OS because there are no runlevels, only targets: \nls /etc/systemd/system/*.wants\nYou can also display similar information with the following command: \nsystemctl list-unit-files --type=service\nHere is a list of some of the systemd commands that take the place of SysVinit commands on Photon OS: \nUSE THIS SYSTEMD COMMAND     INSTEAD OF THIS SYSVINIT COMMAND\nsystemctl start sshd         service sshd start\nsystemctl stop sshd         service sshd stop\nsystemctl restart sshd         service sshd restart\nsystemctl reload sshd         service sshd reload\nsystemctl condrestart sshd     service sshd condrestart\nsystemctl status sshd         service sshd status\nsystemctl enable sshd         chkconfig sshd on\nsystemctl disable sshd         chkconfig sshd off\nsystemctl daemon-reload        chkconfig sshd --add\nAnalyzing System Logs with journalctl\nThe journalctl tool queries the contents of the systemd journal. On Photon OS, all the system logs except the installation log and the cloud-init log are written into the systemd journal. \nIf called without parameters, the journalctl command shows all the contents of the journal, beginning with the oldest entry. To display the output in reverse order with new entries first, include the -r option in the command:\njournalctl -r\nThe journalctl command includes many options to filter its output. For help troubleshooting systemd, two journalctl queries are particularly useful: showing the log entries for the last boot and showing the log entries for a systemd service unit. This command displays the messages that systemd generated during the last time the machine started: \njournalctl -b\nThis command reveals the messages for only the systemd service unit specified by the -u option, which in the following example is the auditing service: \njournalctl -u auditd\nYou can look at the messages for systemd itself or for the network service:\njournalctl -u systemd\njournalctl -u systemd-networkd\nExample:  \nroot@photon-1a0375a0392e [ ~ ]# journalctl -u systemd-networkd\n-- Logs begin at Tue 2016-08-23 14:35:50 UTC, end at Tue 2016-08-23 23:45:44 UTC. --\nAug 23 14:35:52 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd[1]: Starting Network Service...\nAug 23 14:35:52 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd-networkd[458]: Enumeration completed\nAug 23 14:35:52 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd[1]: Started Network Service.\nAug 23 14:35:52 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd-networkd[458]: eth0: Gained carrier\nAug 23 14:35:53 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd-networkd[458]: eth0: DHCPv4 address 198.51.100.1\nAug 23 14:35:54 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd-networkd[458]: eth0: Gained IPv6LL\nAug 23 14:35:54 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd-networkd[458]: eth0: Configured\nFor more information, see journalctl or the journalctl man page by running this command: man journalctl\nInspecting Services with systemd-analyze\nThe systemd-analyze command reveals performance statistics for boot times, traces system services, and verifies unit files. It can help troubleshoot slow system boots and incorrect unit files. See the man page for a list of options. Examples:\nsystemd-analyze blame\n\nsystemd-analyze dump\nNetworking\nManaging the Network Configuration\nThe network service, which is enabled by default, starts when the system boots. You manage the network service by using systemd commands, such as systemd-networkd, systemd-resolvd, and networkctl. You can check its status of the network service by running the following command: \nsystemctl status systemd-networkd\nHere is a healthy result of the command: \n* systemd-networkd.service - Network Service\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Fri 2016-04-29 15:08:51 UTC; 6 days ago\n     Docs: man:systemd-networkd.service(8)\n Main PID: 291 (systemd-network)\n   Status: \"Processing requests...\"\n   CGroup: /system.slice/systemd-networkd.service\n           `-291 /lib/systemd/systemd-networkd\nBecause Photon OS relies on systemd to manage services, you should employ the systemd suite of commands, not deprecated init.d commands or other deprecated commands, to manage networking. \nUse ip and ss Commands Instead of ifconfig and netstat\nAlthough the ifconfig command and the netstat command work on Photon OS, VMware recommends that you use the ip or ss commands. The ifconfig and netstat commands are deprecated. \nFor example, instead of running netstat to display a list of network interfaces, consider running the ss command. Similarly, to display information for IP addresses, instead of running ifconfig -a, run the ip addr command. Examples:\nUSE THIS IPROUTE COMMAND     INSTEAD OF THIS NET-TOOL COMMAND\nip addr                     ifconfig -a\nss                             netstat\nip route                     route\nip maddr                     netstat -g\nip link set eth0 up         ifconfig eth0 up\nip -s neigh                    arp -v\nip link set eth0 mtu 9000    ifconfig eth0 mtu 9000\nUsing the ip route version of a command instead of the net-tools version often provides more complete, accurate information on Photon OS, as the following example demonstrates: \nip neigh\n198.51.100.2 dev eth0 lladdr 00:50:56:e2:02:0f STALE\n198.51.100.254 dev eth0 lladdr 00:50:56:e7:13:d9 STALE\n198.51.100.1 dev eth0 lladdr 00:50:56:c0:00:08 DELAY\n\narp -a\n? (198.51.100.2) at 00:50:56:e2:02:0f [ether] on eth0\n? (198.51.100.254) at 00:50:56:e7:13:d9 [ether] on eth0\n? (198.51.100.1) at 00:50:56:c0:00:08 [ether] on eth0\nImportant: If you modify an IPv6 configuration or add an IPv6 interface, you must restart systemd-networkd. Traditional methods of using ifconfig commands will be inadequate to register the changes. Run the following command instead: \nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nInspecting the Status of Network Links with networkctl\nThe networkctl command shows information about network connections that helps you configure networking services and troubleshoot networking problems. You can, for example, progressively add options and arguments to the networkctl command to move from general information about network connections to specific information about a network connection. \nRunning networkctl without options defaults to the list command:  \nnetworkctl\nIDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL SETUP\n  1 lo               loopback           carrier     unmanaged\n  2 eth0             ether              routable    configured\n  3 docker0          ether              routable    unmanaged\n 11 vethb0aa7a6      ether              degraded    unmanaged\n 4 links listed.\nRunning networkctl with the status command displays information that looks like this; you can see there are active network links with IP addresses for not only the Ethernet connection but also a Docker container. \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# networkctl status\n*      State: routable\n     Address: 198.51.100.131 on eth0\n              172.17.0.1 on docker0\n              fe80::20c:29ff:fe55:3ca6 on eth0\n              fe80::42:f0ff:fef7:bd81 on docker0\n              fe80::4c84:caff:fe76:a23f on vethb0aa7a6\n     Gateway: 198.51.100.2 on eth0\n         DNS: 198.51.100.2\nYou can then add a network link, such as the Ethernet connection, as the argument of the status command to show specific information about the link: \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# networkctl status eth0\n* 2: eth0\n       Link File: /usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n    Network File: /etc/systemd/network/10-dhcp-en.network\n            Type: ether\n           State: routable (configured)\n            Path: pci-0000:02:01.0\n          Driver: e1000\n      HW Address: 00:0c:29:55:3c:a6 (VMware, Inc.)\n             MTU: 1500\n         Address: 198.51.100.131\n                  fe80::20c:29ff:fe55:3ca6\n         Gateway: 198.51.100.2\n             DNS: 198.51.100.2\n        CLIENTID: ffb6220feb00020000ab116724f520a0a77337\nAnd you can do the same thing with the Docker container: \nnetworkctl status docker0\n* 3: docker0\n       Link File: /usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n    Network File: n/a\n            Type: ether\n           State: routable (unmanaged)\n          Driver: bridge\n      HW Address: 02:42:f0:f7:bd:81\n             MTU: 1500\n         Address: 172.17.0.1\n                  fe80::42:f0ff:fef7:bd81\nIn the example above, it is OK that the state of the Docker container is unmanaged; Docker handles managing the networking for the containers without using systemd-resolved or systemd-networkd. Instead, Docker manages the container's connection by using its bridge drive.\nFor more information about networkctl commands and options, see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/networkctl.html.\nTurning on Network Debugging\nYou can set systemd-networkd to work in debug mode so that you can analyze log files with debugging information to help troubleshoot networking problems. The following procedure turns on network debugging by adding a drop-in file in /etc/systemd to customize the default systemd configuration in /usr/lib/systemd. \nFirst, run the following command as root to create a directory with this exact name, including the .d extension:\nmkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/\nSecond, run the following command as root to establish a systemd drop-in unit with a debugging configuration for the network service:\ncat > /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/10-loglevel-debug.conf You must reload the systemctl daemon and restart the systemd-networkd service for the changes to take effect: \nsystemctl daemon-reload\nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nVerify that your changes took effect:\nsystemd-delta --type=extended\nView the log files by running this command: \njournalctl -u systemd-networkd\nWhen you are finished debugging the network connections, turn debugging off by deleting the drop-in file: \nrm /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/10-loglevel-debug.conf\nInstalling the Packages for tcpdump and netcat with tdnf\nThe minimal version of Photon OS leaves out several useful networking tools to keep the operating system lean. Tcpdump, for example, is absent in the minimal version but available in the repository. The minimal version does, however, include the iproute2 tools by default. \nTcpdump captures and analyzes packets on a network interface. On Photon OS, you install tcpdump and its accompanying package libpcap, a C/C++ library for capturing network traffic, by using tdnf, Photon's command-line package manager: \ntdnf install tcpdump\nNetcat, a tool for sending data over network connections with TCP or UDP, appears in neither the minimal nor the full version of Photon OS. But since netcat furnishes powerful options for analyzing, troubleshooting, and debugging network connections, you might want to install it. To do so, run the following command: \ntdnf install netcat\nChecking Firewall Rules\nThe design of Photon OS emphasizes security. On the minimal and full versions of Photon OS, the default security policy turns on the firewall and drops packets from external interfaces and  applications. As a result, you might need to add rules to iptables to permit forwarding, allow protocols like HTTP, and open ports. In other words, you must configure the firewall for your applications and requirements. \nThe default iptables settings on the full version look like this:\niptables --list\nChain INPUT (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED\nACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:ssh\n\nChain FORWARD (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\n\nChain OUTPUT (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nTo find out how to adjust the settings, see the man page for iptables. \nAlthough the default iptables policy accepts SSH connections, the sshd configuration file on the full version of Photon OS  is set to reject SSH connections. See Permitting Root Login with SSH.\nIf you are unable to ping a Photon OS machine, one of the first things you should do is check the firewall rules. Do they allow connectivity for the port and protocol in question? You can supplement the iptables commands by using lsof to, for instance, see the processes listening on ports: \nlsof -i -P -n\nNetmgr\nIf you are running a VMware appliance on Photon OS and the VAMI module has problems or if there are networking issues, you can use the Photon OS netmgr utility to inspect the networking settings. Make sure, in particular, that the IP addresses for the DNS server and other infrastructure are correct. Use tcpdump to analyze the issues. \nIf you get an error code from netmgr, it is a standard Unix error code--enter it into a search engine to obtain more information.\nFile System\nThis section covers troubleshooting the file system.\nChecking Disk Space\nOne of the first simple steps to take when you're troubleshooting is to check how much disk space is available by running the df command: \ndf -h\nAdding a Disk and Partitioning It\nIf the df command shows that the file system is indeed nearing capacity, you can add a new disk on the fly and partition it to increase capacity. \nFirst, add a new disk. You can, for example, add a new disk to a virtual machine by using the VMware vSphere Client. After adding a new disk, check for the new disk by using fdisk; see the section on fdisk below. In the following example, the new disk is named /dev/sdb:\nfdisk -l\nDevice        Start      End  Sectors Size Type\n/dev/sda1      2048 16771071 16769024   8G Linux filesystem\n/dev/sda2  16771072 16777182     6111   3M BIOS boot\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 1 GiB, 1073741824 bytes, 2097152 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nAfter you confirm that Photon OS registers the new disk, you can partition it with the parted wizard. The command to partition the disk on Photon OS is as follows: \nparted /dev/sdb\nAnd then you use the parted wizard to create it (see the man page for parted for more information):\nmklabel gpt\nmkpart ext3 1 1024\nThen you must create a file system on the partition:\nmkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdb1\nMake a directory where you will mount the new file system: \nmkdir /newdata\nFinally, open /etc/fstab and add the new file system with the options that you want: \n#system mnt-pt  type    options dump    fsck\n/dev/sda1       /       ext4    defaults,barrier,noatime,noacl,data=ord$\n/dev/cdrom      /mnt/cdrom      iso9660 ro,noauto       0       0\n/dev/sdb1       /newdata        ext3    defaults        0        0\nMount it for now: \nmount /newdata\nCheck your work: \ndf -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/root       7.8G  4.4G  3.1G  59% /\ndevtmpfs        172M     0  172M   0% /dev\ntmpfs           173M     0  173M   0% /dev/shm\ntmpfs           173M  664K  172M   1% /run\ntmpfs           173M     0  173M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\ntmpfs           173M   36K  173M   1% /tmp\ntmpfs            35M     0   35M   0% /run/user/0\n/dev/sdb1       945M  1.3M  895M   1% /newdata\nExpanding Disk Partition\nIf you need more space, you can expand the last partition of your disk after resizing the disk. In the examples we are assuming sda as disk device.\nAfter the disk is resized in the virtual machine, it's necessary to tell the system to recognize the new disk ending boundary without rebooting:\necho 1 > /sys/class/block/sda/device/rescan\nYou will need to install the parted package to resize the disk partition, which is not available by default. Just run the following command to install it: tdnf install parted.\n# parted /dev/sda\nGNU Parted 3.2\nUsing /dev/sda\nWelcome to GNU Parted! Type 'help' to view a list of commands.\nList all partitions available to fix the GPT and check the last partition number:\n(parted) print\n\nWarning: Not all of the space available to /dev/sda appears to be used, you can\nfix the GPT to use all of the space (an extra 4194304 blocks) or continue with\nthe current setting? \nFix/Ignore?\nPress f to fix the GPT layout.\nModel: VMware Virtual disk (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 34.4GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: gpt\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name  Flags\n1      1049kB  3146kB  2097kB                     bios_grub\n2      3146kB  8590MB  8587MB  ext4\nIn this case we have the partition 2 as last, then we extend the partition to 100% of the remaining size:\n(parted) resizepart 2 100%\nFinally, expand the filesystem to the new size:\nresize2fs /dev/sda2\nresize2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)\nFilesystem at /dev/sda2 is mounted on /; on-line resizing required\nold_desc_blocks = 1, new_desc_blocks = 2\nThe filesystem on /dev/sda2 is now 8387835 (4k) blocks long.\nThe new space is already available in the system:\ndf -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/root        32G  412M   30G   2% /\ndevtmpfs       1001M     0 1001M   0% /dev\ntmpfs          1003M     0 1003M   0% /dev/shm\ntmpfs          1003M  252K 1003M   1% /run\ntmpfs          1003M     0 1003M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\ntmpfs          1003M     0 1003M   0% /tmp\ntmpfs           201M     0  201M   0% /run/user/0\nfdisk\nThe fdisk command manipulates the disk partition table. You can, for example, use fdisk to list the disk partitions so that you can identify the root Linux file system. Here is an truncated example showing /dev/sda1 to be the root Linux partition: \nfdisk -l\nDisk /dev/ram0: 4 MiB, 4194304 bytes, 8192 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\n...\nDisk /dev/sda: 8 GiB, 8589934592 bytes, 16777216 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: gpt\nDisk identifier: 3CFA568B-2C89-4290-8B52-548732A3972D\n\nDevice        Start      End  Sectors Size Type\n/dev/sda1      2048 16771071 16769024   8G Linux filesystem\n/dev/sda2  16771072 16777182     6111   3M BIOS boot\nRemember the fdisk -l command--it will be used later in a section that demonstrates how to reset a lost root password. \nfsck\nThe Photon OS file system includes btrfs and ext4. The default root file system is ext4, which you can see by looking at the file system configuration file, /etc/fstab: \ncat /etc/fstab\n#system mnt-pt  type    options dump    fsck\n/dev/sda1       /       ext4    defaults,barrier,noatime,noacl,data=ordered     1       1\n/dev/cdrom      /mnt/cdrom      iso9660 ro,noauto       0       0\nThe 1 in the fifth column, under fsck, indicates that fsck checks the file system when the system boots.\nYou can manually check the file system by using the file system consistency check tool, fsck, after you unmount the file system. You can also perform a read-only check without unmounting it:\nfsck -nf /dev/sda1\nfsck from util-linux 2.27.1\ne2fsck 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)\nWarning!  /dev/sda1 is mounted.\nWarning: skipping journal recovery because doing a read-only filesystem check.\nPass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes\nPass 2: Checking directory structure\nPass 3: Checking directory connectivity\nPass 4: Checking reference counts\nPass 5: Checking group summary information\nFree blocks count wrong (1439651, counted=1423942).\nFix? no\nFree inodes count wrong (428404, counted=428397).\nFix? no\n/dev/sda1: 95884/524288 files (0.3% non-contiguous), 656477/2096128 blocks\nThe inodes count is probably off because the file system is mounted and in use. To fix problems, you must first unmount the file system and then run fsck again: \numount /dev/sda1\numount: /: target is busy\n        (In some cases useful info about processes that\n         use the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1).)\nSo check it with lsof:\nlsof | grep ^jbd2/sd\njbd2/sda1   99                root  cwd       DIR                8,1     4096          2 /\njbd2/sda1   99                root  rtd       DIR                8,1     4096          2 /\njbd2/sda1   99                root  txt   unknown                                        /proc/99/exe\nThe file system is indeed in use. What troubleshooting tool would you use next to further explore the applications or processes that are using the file system?  \nFixing File System Errors When fsck Fails\nA potential issue is that when fsck runs during startup, it finds a problem that prevents the system from fully booting until you fix the issue by running fsck manually. This kind of a problem can occur when Photon OS is the operating system for a VM running an appliance. \nIf fsck fails when the computer boots and an error message says to run fsck manually, you can troubleshoot by restarting the VM, altering the GRUB edit menu to enter emergency mode before Photon OS fully boots, and running fsck.\n\nTake a snapshot of the virtual machine. \n\nRestart the virtual machine running Photon OS. \n\nWhen the Photon OS splash screen appears as it restarts, type the letter e to go to the GNU GRUB edit menu. Be quick about it: Because Photon OS reboots so quickly, you won't have much time to type e. Remember that in VMware vSphere or VMware Workstation Pro, you might have to give the console focus by clicking in its window before it will register input from the keyboard. \n\nIn the GNU GRUB edit menu, go to the end of the line that starts with linux, add a space, and then add the following code exactly as it appears below:\n systemd.unit=emergency.target\n\nType F10.\n\nIn the bash shell, run one of the following commands to fix the file system errors, depending on whether sda1 or sda2 represents the root file system: \n e2fsck -y /dev/sda1\n or\n e2fsck -y /dev/sda2\n\nRestart the virtual machine.\n\n\nPackages\nOn Photon OS, tdnf is the default package manager. The standard syntax for tdnf commands is the same as that for DNF and Yum: \ntdnf [options]  [...]\nThe main configuration files reside in /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf. The repositories appear in /etc/yum.repos.d/ with .repo file extensions. For more information, see the Photon OS Administration Guide.\nThe cache files for data and metadata reside in /var/cache/tdnf. The local cache is populated with data from the repository: \nls -l /var/cache/tdnf/photon\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 May 18 22:52 repodata\nd-wxr----t 3 root root 4096 May  3 22:51 rpms\nYou can clear the cache to help troubleshoot a problem, but keep in mind that doing so might slow the performance of tdnf until the cache becomes repopulated with data. Cleaning the cache can remove stale information. Here is how to clear the cache: \ntdnf clean all\nCleaning repos: photon photon-extras photon-updates lightwave\nCleaning up everything\nSome tdnf commands can help you troubleshoot problems with packages:\nmakecache: This command updates the cached binary metadata for all known repositories. You can run it after you clean the cache to make sure you are working with the latest repository data as you troubleshoot. Example:\ntdnf makecache\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)Updates'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Extras 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)'\nMetadata cache created.\ntdnf check-local: This command resolves dependencies by using the local RPMs to help check RPMs for quality assurance before publishing them. To check RPMs with this command, you must create a local directory and place your RPMs in it. The command, which includes no options, takes the path to the local directory containing the RPMs as its argument. The command does not, however, recursively parse directories; it checks the RPMs only in the directory that you specify. For example, after creating a directory named /tmp/myrpms and placing your RPMs in it, you can run the following command to check them:  \ntdnf check-local /tmp/myrpms\nChecking all packages from: /tmp/myrpms\nFound 10 packages\nCheck completed without issues\ntdnf provides: This command finds the packages that provide the package that you supply as an argument. If you are used to a package name for another system, you can use tdnf provides to find the corresponding name of the package on Photon OS. Example: \ntdnf provides docker\ndocker-1.11.0-1.ph1.x86_64 : Docker\nRepo     : photon\ndocker-1.11.0-1.ph1.x86_64 : Docker\nRepo     : @System\nFor a file, you must provide the full path. Here's an example: \ntdnf provides /usr/include/stdio.h\nglibc-devel-2.22-8.ph1.x86_64 : Header files for glibc\nRepo     : photon\nglibc-devel-2.22-8.ph1.x86_64 : Header files for glibc\nRepo     : @System\nHere's an example that shows you how to find the package that provides a pluggable authentication module, which you might need to find if the system is mishandling passwords. \ntdnf provides /etc/pam.d/system-account\nshadow-4.2.1-7.ph1.x86_64 : Programs for handling passwords in a secure way\nRepo     : photon\nshadow-4.2.1-8.ph1.x86_64 : Programs for handling passwords in a secure way\nRepo     : photon-updates\nAdditional commands appear in the Photon OS Administration Guide.\nIf you find a package that is installed but is not working, try re-installing it; example: \ntdnf reinstall shadow\nReinstalling:\nshadow     x86_64     4.2.1-7.ph1   3.85 M\nKernel Problems and Boot and Login Problems\nKernel Overview\nPhoton OS 1.0 uses Linux kernel version 4.4. Troubleshooting kernel problems starts with dmesg. The dmesg command prints messages from the kernel ring buffer. The following command, for example, presents kernel messages in a human-readable format: \ndmesg --human --kernel\nTo examine kernel messages as you perform actions, such as reproducing a problem, in another terminal, you can run the command with the --follow option, which waits for new messages and prints them as they occur: \ndmesg --human --kernel --follow\nThe kernel buffer is limited in memory size. As a result, the kernel cyclically overwrites the end of the information in the buffer from which dmesg pulls information. The systemd journal, however, saves the information from the buffer to a log file so that you can access older information. To view it, run the following command: \njournalctl -k\nIf need be, you can check the modules that are loaded on your Photon OS machine by running the lsmod command; truncated example:  \nlsmod\nModule                  Size  Used by\nvmw_vsock_vmci_transport    28672  1\nvsock                  36864  2 vmw_vsock_vmci_transport\ncoretemp               16384  0\nhwmon                  16384  1 coretemp\ncrc32c_intel           24576  0\nhid_generic            16384  0\nusbhid                 28672  0\nhid                   106496  2 hid_generic,usbhid\nxt_conntrack           16384  1\niptable_nat            16384  0\nnf_conntrack_ipv4      16384  2\nnf_defrag_ipv4         16384  1 nf_conntrack_ipv4\nnf_nat_ipv4            16384  1 iptable_nat\nnf_nat                 24576  1 nf_nat_ipv4\niptable_filter         16384  1\nip_tables              24576  2 iptable_filter,iptable_nat\nBoot Process Overview\nWhen a Photon OS machine boots, the BIOS initializes the hardware and uses a boot loader to start the kernel. After the kernel starts, systemd takes over and boots the rest of the operating system. \nMore specifically, the BIOS checks the memory and initializes the keyboard, the screen, and other peripherals. When the BIOS finds the first hard disk, the boot loader--GNU GRUB 2.02--takes over. From the hard disk, GNU GRUB loads the master boot record (MBR) and initializes the root partition of the random-access memory by using initrd. The device manager, udev, provides initrd with the drivers it needs to access the device containing the root file system. Here's what the GNU GRUB edit menu looks like in Photon OS with its default commands to load the boot record and initialize the RAM disk: \n  \nAt this point, the Linux kernel in Photon OS, which is kernel version 4.4.8, takes control. Systemd kicks in, initializes services in parallel, mounts the rest of the file system, and checks the file system for errors. \nBlank Screen on Reboot\nIf the Photon OS kernel enters a state of panic during a reboot and all you see is a blank screen, note the name of the virtual machine running Photon OS and then power off the VM. \nIn the host, open the vmware.log file for the VM. When a kernel panics, the guest VM prints the entire kernel log in  vmware.log in the host's directory containing the VM. This log file contains the output of the dmesg command from the guest, and you can analyze it to help identify the cause of the boot problem. \nHere's an example. After searching for Guest: in the following abridged vmware.log, this line appears, identifying the root cause of the reboot problem: \n2016-08-30T16:02:43.220-07:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: \n[1.125804] Kernel panic - not syncing: \nVFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)\nFurther inspection finds the following lines: \n2016-08-30T16:02:43.217-07:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: \n[    1.125782] VFS: Cannot open root device \"sdc1\" or unknown-block(0,0): error -6\n2016-08-30T16:02:43.217-07:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: \n[    1.125783] Please append a correct \"root=\" boot option; \nhere are the available partitions: \n2016-08-30T16:02:43.217-07:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: \n[    1.125785] 0100            4096 ram0  (driver?)\n...\n0800         8388608 sda  driver: sd\n2016-08-30T16:02:43.220-07:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: \n[    1.125802]   0801         8384512 sda1 611e2d9a-a3da-4ac7-9eb9-8d09cb151a93\n2016-08-30T16:02:43.220-07:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: \n[    1.125803]   0802            3055 sda2 8159e59c-b382-40b9-9070-3c5586f3c7d6\nIn this unlikely case, the GRUB configuration points to a root device named sdc1 instead of the correct root device, sda1. You can fix the problem by restoring the GRUB GNU edit screen and the GRUB configuration file (/boot/grub/grub.cfg) to their original configurations. \nInvestigating Strange Behavior\nIf you rebooted to address strange behavior before the reboot of if you encountered strange behavior during the reboot but have reached the shell, you should analyze what happened since the previous boot. Start broad by running the following command to check the logs: \njournalctl\nNext, run the following command to look at what happened since the penultimate reboot: \njournalctl --boot=-1\nThen look at the log from the reboot: \njournalctl -b\nIf need be, examine the logs for the kernel: \njournalctl -k\nCheck which kernel is in use:\nuname -r\nThe kernel version of Photon OS in the full version is 4.4.8. The kernel version of in the OVA version is 4.4.8-esx. With the ESX version of the kernel, some services might not start. Run this command to check the overall status of services: \nsystemctl status \nIf a service is in red, check it: \nsystemctl status service-name\nStart it if need be: \nsystemctl start service-name\nIf looking at the journal and checking the status of services gets you nowhere, run the following systemd-analyze commands to examine the boot time and the speed with which services start.\nsystemd-analyze time\nsystemd-analyze blame\nsystemd-analyze critical-chain\nKeep in mind that the output of these commands might be misleading because one service might just be waiting for another service to finish initializing.\nInvestigating the Guest Kernel When You Cannot Log On\nIf a VM running Photon OS and an application or virtual appliance is behaving so oddly that, for example, you cannot log on to the machine, you can still troubleshoot by extracting the kernel logs from the guest's memory and analyzing them with gdb. \nThis advanced troubleshooting method works when you are running Photon OS as the operating system for an application or appliance on VMware Workstation, Fusion, or ESXi. This approach assumes that the virtual machine running Photon OS is functioning normally. \nThis troubleshooting method has the following requirements: \n\nRoot access to a Linux machine other than the one you are troubleshooting. It can be another Photon OS machine, Ubuntu, or another Linux variant. \nThe vmss2core utility from VMware. It is installed by default in VMware Workstation and some other VMware products. If your system doesn't already contain it, you can download it for free from https://labs.vmware.com/flings/vmss2core.\nA local copy of the Photon OS ISO of the exact same version and release number as the Photon OS machine that you are troubleshooting. \n\nThe process to use this troubleshooting method varies by environment. The examples in this section assume that the troublesome Photon OS virtual machine is running in VMware Workstation 12 Pro on a Microsoft Windows 8 Enterprise host. The examples also use an additional, fully functional Photon OS virtual machine running in Workstation.\nYou can, however, use other hosts, hypervisors, and operating systems--but you will have to adapt the example process below to them. Directory paths, file names, and other aspects might be different on other systems. \nOverview   \nThe process to apply this troubleshooting method goes like this: On a local computer, you open a file on the Photon OS ISO that contains Linux debugging information. Then you suspend the troublesome Photon OS VM and extract the kernel memory logs from the VMware hypervisor running Photon OS. \nNext, you use the vmss2core tool to convert the memory logs into core dump files. The vmss2core utility converts VMware checkpoint state files into formats that third-party debugging tools understand. It can handle both suspend (.vmss) and snapshot (.vmsn) checkpoint state files (hereafter referred to as a vmss file) as well as monolithic and non-monolithic (separate .vmem file) encapsulation of checkpoint state data. See Debugging Virtual Machines with the Checkpoint to Core Tool.\nFinally, you prepare to run the gdb tool by using the debug info file from the ISO to create a .gdbinit file, which you can then analyze with the gdb shell on your local Linux machine.\nAll three components must be in the same directory on a Linux machine.  \nProcess\nFirst, obtain a local copy of the Photon OS ISO of the exact same version and release number as the Photon OS machine that you are troubleshooting and mount the ISO on a Linux machine (or open it on a Windows machine):\nmount /mnt/cdrom\nSecond, locate the following file. (If you opened the Photon OS ISO on a Windows computer, copy the following file to the root folder of a Linux machine.)\n/RPMS/x86_64/linux-debuginfo-4.4.8-6.ph1.x86_64.rpm\nThird, on a Linux machine, run the following rpm2cpio command to convert the RPM file to a cpio file and to extract the contents of the RPM to the current directory:\nrpm2cpio /mnt/cdrom/RPMS/x86_64/linux-debuginfo-4.4.8-6.ph1.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idmv\nFrom the extracted files, copy the following file to your current directory: \ncp usr/lib/debug/lib/modules/4.4.8/vmlinux-4.4.8.debug .\nRun the following command to download the dmesg functions that will help extract the kernel log from the coredump: \nwget https://github.com/vmware/photon/blob/master/tools/scripts/gdbmacros-for-linux.txt\nMove the file as follows: \nmv gdbmacros-for-linux.txt .gdbinit\nNext, switch to your host machine so you can get the kernel memory files from the VM. Suspend the troublesome VM and locate the .vmss and .vmem files in the virtual machine's directory on the host. Example: \nC:\\Users\\tester\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit (7)>dir\n Volume in drive C is Windows\n Directory of C:\\Users\\tester\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit\n (7)\n09/20/2016  12:22 PM              .\n09/20/2016  12:22 PM              ..\n09/19/2016  03:39 PM       402,653,184 VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-f6b070cd.vmem\n09/20/2016  12:11 PM         5,586,907 VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-f6b070cd.vmss\n09/20/2016  12:11 PM     1,561,001,984 VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-s001.vmdk\n...\n09/20/2016  12:11 PM           300,430 vmware.log\n...\nNow that you have located the .vmss and .vmem files, convert them to one or more core dump files by using the vmss2core tool that comes with Workstation. Here is an example of how to run the command. Be careful with your pathing, escaping, file names, and so forth--all of which might be different from this example on your Windows machine. \nC:\\Users\\shoenisch\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit (7)>C:\\\"Program Files (x86)\\VMware\\VMware Workstation\"\\vmss2core.exe \"VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-f6b070cd.vmss\" \"VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-f6b070cd.vmem\"\nThe result of this command is one or more files with a .core extension plus a digit. Truncated example: \nC:\\Users\\tester\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit (7)>dir\n Directory of C:\\Users\\tester\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit(7)\n09/20/2016  12:22 PM       729,706,496 vmss.core0\nCopy the .core file or files to the your current directory on the Linux machine where you so that you can analyze it with gdb. \nRun the following gdb command to enter the gdb shell attached to the memory core dump file. You might have to change the name of the vmss.core file in the example to match your .core file:\ngdb vmlinux-4.4.8.debug vmss.core0\n\nGNU gdb (GDB) 7.8.2\nCopyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later \nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it. \nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law. ...\nType \"show configuration\" for configuration details.\nFor bug reporting instructions, please see:\n.\nFind the GDB manual and other documentation resources online at: .\nFor help, type \"help\".\nType \"apropos word\" to search for commands related to \"word\"...\nReading symbols from vmlinux-4.4.8.debug...done.\nwarning: core file may not match specified executable file.\n[New LWP 12345]\nCore was generated by `GuestVM'.\nProgram terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n#0  0xffffffff813df39a in insb (count=0, addr=0xffffc90000144000, port=)\n    at arch/x86/include/asm/io.h:316\n316     arch/x86/include/asm/io.h: No such file or directory.\n(gdb)\nIn the results above, the (gdb) of the last line is the prompt of the gdb shell. You can now analyze the core dump by using commands like bt (to perform a backtrace) and dmesg (to view the Photon OS kernel log and see Photon OS kernel error messages). \nKernel Log Replication with VProbes\nReplicating the Photon OS kernel logs on the VMware ESXi host is an advanced but powerful method of troubleshooting a kernel problem. This method is applicable when the virtual machine running Photon OS is hanging or inaccessible because, for instance, the hard disk has failed.\nThere is a prerequisite, however: You must have preemptively enabled the VMware VProbes facility on the VM before a problem rendered it inaccessible. You must also create a VProbes script on the ESXi host, but you can do that after the fact. \nAlthough the foresight to implement these prerequisites might limit the application of this troubleshooting method for production systems, the method can be particularly useful in analyzing kernel issues when testing an application or appliance that is running on Photon OS.   \nThere are two similar ways in which you can replicate the Photon OS kernel logs on ESXi by using VProbes. The first modifies the VProbes script so that it works only for the VM that you set; it uses a hard-coded address. The second uses an abstraction instead of a hard-coded address so that the same VProbes script can be used for any VM on an ESXi host that you have enabled for VProbe and copied its kernel symbol table (kallsyms) to ESXi.\nFor more information on VMware VProbes, see VProbes: Deep Observability Into the ESXi Hypervisor and the VProbes Programming Reference.\nUsing VProbes Script with a Hard-Coded Address\nHere's how to set a VProbe for an individual VM: \nFirst, power off the VM so that you can turn on the VProbe facility. Edit the .vmx configuration file for the VM. The file resides in the directory that contains the VM in the ESXi data store. Add the following line of code to the .vmx file and then power the VM on: \nvprobe.enable = \"TRUE\"\nWhen you edit the .vmx file to add the above line of code, you must first turn off the VM--otherwise, your changes will not persist. \nSecond, obtain the kernel log_store function address by connecting to the VM with SSH and running the following commands as root. (Photon OS uses the kptr_restrict setting to place restrictions on the kernel addresses exposed through /proc and other interfaces. This setting hides exposed kernel pointers to prevent attackers from exploiting kernel write vulnerabilities. When you are done using VProbes, you should return kptr_restrict to the original setting of 2 by rebooting.)\necho 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict\ngrep log_store /proc/kallsyms\nThe output of the grep command will look similar to the following string. The first set of characters (without the t) is the log_store function address:\nffffffff810bb680 t log_store\nThird, connect to the ESXi host with SSH so that you can create a VProbes script. Here's the template for the script; log_store in the first line is a placeholder for the VM's log_store function address: \nGUEST:ENTER:log_store {\n   string dst;\n   getgueststr(dst, getguest(RSP+16) & 0xff, getguest(RSP+8));\n   printf(\"%s\\n\", dst);\n}\nOn the ESXi host, create a new file, add the template to it, and then change log_store to the function address that was the output from the grep command on the VM. \nYou must add a 0x prefix to the function address. In this example, the modified template looks like this: \nGUEST:ENTER:0xffffffff810bb680 {\n   string dst;\n   getgueststr(dst, getguest(RSP+16) & 0xff, getguest(RSP+8));\n   printf(\"%s\\n\", dst);\n}\nSave your VProbes script as console.emt in the /tmp directory. (The file extension for VProbe scripts is .emt.) \nWhile still connected to the ESXi host with SSH, run the following command to obtain the ID of the virtual machine that you want to troubleshoot: \nvim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms\nThis command lists all the VMs running on the ESXi host. Find the VM you want to troubleshoot in the list and make a note of its ID. \nFinally, run the following command to print all the kernel messages from Photon OS in your SSH console; replace  with the ID of your VM:  \nvprobe -m  /tmp/console.emt\nWhen you're done, type Ctrl-C to stop the loop. \nA Reusable VProbe Script Using the kallsyms File\nHere's how to create one VProbe script and use for all the VMs on your ESXi host. \nFirst, power off the VM and turn on the VProbe facility on each VM that you want to be able to analyze. Add vprobe.enable = \"TRUE\" to the VM's .vmx configuration file. See the instructions above. \nSecond, power on the VM, connect to it with SSH, and run the following command as root: \necho 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict\nThird, connect to the ESXi host with SSH to create the following VProbes script and save it as /tmp/console.emt:\nGUEST:ENTER:log_store {\n   string dst;\n   getgueststr(dst, getguest(RSP+16) & 0xff, getguest(RSP+8));\n   printf(\"%s\\n\", dst);\n}\nFourth, from the ESXi host, run the following command to copy the VM's kallysms file to the tmp directory on the ESXi host: \nscp root@:/proc/kallsyms /tmp\nWhile still connected to the ESXi host with SSH, run the following command to obtain the ID of the virtual machine that you want to troubleshoot: \nvim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms\nThis command lists all the VMs running on the ESXi host. Find the VM you want to troubleshoot in the list and make a note of its ID. \nFinally, run the following command to print all the kernel messages from Photon OS in your SSH console; replace  with the ID of your VM. When you're done, type Ctrl-C to stop the loop.  \nvprobe -m  -k /tmp/kallysyms /tmp/console.emt\nYou can use a directory other than tmp if you want.\n\n\nPerformance Issues\nPerformance issues can be difficult to troubleshoot because so many variables play a role in overall system performance. Interpreting performance data often depends on the context and the situation. To better identify and isolate variables and to gain insight into performance data, you can use the troubleshooting tools on Photon OS to diagnose the system.  \nIf you have no indication what the cause of a performance degradation might be, start by getting a broad picture of the system's state. Then look for clues in the data that might point to a cause. The systemd journal is a useful place to start. \nThe top tool can unmask problems caused by processes or applications overconsuming CPUs, time, or RAM. If the percent of CPU utilization is consistently high with little idle time, for example, there might be a runaway process. Restart it. \nThe netstat --statistics command can identify bottlenecks causing performance issues. It lists interface statistics for different protocols. \nIf top and netstat reveal no clues, run the strace ls -al to view every system call.\nThe following watch command can help dynamically monitor a command to help troubleshoot performance issues:\nwatch -n0 --differences \nYou can, for example, combine watch with the vmstat command to dig deeper into statistics about virtual memory, processes, block input-output, disks, and CPU activity. Are there any bottlenecks? \nAnother option is to use the dstat utility. It shows a live, running list of statistics about system resources. \nIn addition, systemd-analyze, which reveals performance statistics for boot times, can help troubleshoot slow system boots and incorrect unit files.\nThe additional tools that you select depend on the clues that your initial investigation reveals. The following tools can also help troubleshoot performance: sysstat, sar, systemtap, and crash. \n"}}}
